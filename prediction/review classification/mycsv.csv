0,KbpXKhBTHc0wToeztkdjyg,"A friend of mine gave me the ""newbie's tour"" of Desta last night.  Technically, I have eaten Ethiopian food once in Washington, DC, but it was about 17 years ago and I was a teenager at the time.  I think my parents chose what we ordered (or maybe the server recommended something) and all I really remember is the part where you use the bread as your utensil.  I've killed a lot of brain cells since then.

My friend recommended the Beef (Tenderloin) Tibs with Shiro and the Vegetarian Combo.  She also explained to me that while a lot of Ethiopian food is very heavy on the sauce, Desta uses a lighter amount of sauce.  They say that the reason for that is that they're proud of their ingredients.  I can see why, because everything was very good.

If you ask to share your food between the members of your party, all the food will come out on one huge plate together.  This allows you to eat ""family style"" - and also entertainingly reach across the table pretty far, although fortunately, the tables are small so the reach isn't so bad.  The restaurant thoughtfully provides hand sanitizer at each table, which is probably a good idea when you're eating with your hands and sharing food.

The Beef Tibs with Shiro was delicious.  I'm a big fan of beef, and this tasted like high-quality meat.  It was seasoned perfectly (for being tasty - I have no way to know what ""perfect"" Ethiopian seasoning is yet) and accompanied by onions, tomatoes and I believe fresh jalapeno pieces.  And the shiro was yummy, too - I love hummus so it's unlikely that I'd ever complain about a flavorful chickpea paste. 

The Vegetarian Platter was great, too.  I wasn't sure of exactly what items I was eating, so I came home and looked at the menu.  After I looked at the menu, I'm still not sure of all the items I ate because I feel like there were things we ate that aren't listed on the menu and vice versa.  (Not that I mind not knowing what I'm eating, because I eat Korean food pretty often now that I live out in BFE and I usually only know what about 30% of the banchan items are.)

Anyway, everything on the veggie plate was good (except that my friend and I did not try the halved fresh jalapeno with tomatoes because neither of us wanted that much fresh jalapeno).  Some items I remember trying were the collard green stew, the split pea stew, more shiro, a beet and potato salad, and a yellow-tinted cabbage dish.  

There was also a salad of lettuce and tomatoes and a red paste which I loved and think it might have been vegetarian fir fir.  Oh, and there was also a dish that was made out of pieces of injera (the flat sourdough-tasting bread that you use to scoop up your food) and something that tasted like olive oil and maybe vinegar.  From looking at the menu now, I think that may have been a fit fit of some kind.  

My favorite veggie items were definitely the shiro, the red paste, and the collards.  But there was nothing on that plate that I didn't like.  All of the items were served over more injera.  I guess I should have read the review earlier that mentioned that you are supposed to eat that injera too because it's yummy and has soaked up all the flavors.  Oops.

(Yeah, in retrospect that seems like common sense.  But my friend was minimizing her bread consumption and my week at work has been rough.  I don't think my brain is functioning at full capacity anymore.)

With all the food we ordered, our total check only came to around 24 bucks.  Not too bad for the opportunity to try a million and one items (well, maybe more like 10 items).  I let satiated but not stuffed, and looking forward to trying some more things the next time I eat at an Ethiopian restaurant.

My experience at Desta was definitely enjoyable.  The food was great and our service completely on point.  The main reason I'm not giving a full five stars is that I don't feel really qualified to judge Ethiopian food since I have so little experience with it.  Give me time to build a basis for comparison, and this may become 5 stars for me.

Oh, and on our way out of the restaurant, we noticed that Desta has a drive thru.  Drive-thru Ethiopian cuisine?  Win.",4.0
1,kO9iZt0Bg79wQR3QTMYsTg,"Exquisite food, great cocktails and beer. I go to Columbus for business and a friend recommended this place. I had a pork tenderloin to die for. Perfectly prepared, oven roasted vegetables and reasonably priced. They even knew how to make a Last Word.

The service was responsive and attentive. It was so good that I took my client there the next day for lunch. Perfect burger and salad.

Fast forward two months and I returned with my wife. Unlike me, she is a Pescetarian, no meats only fish and veggies, and I suggested Wolf Ridge. The tenderloin was gone, they revise menus regularly, and she had a vegun risotto grain dish. Superb. Grains were slightly el dente. I had the Tomahawk chop and we shared a forest floor salad (wild greens, mushrooms, walnuts, blue cheese and a wonderful vinaigrette). 

A little of the beaten track but worth it. 

The only downside is the acoustics. The place gets loud so out is not a place for a quiet intimate dinner but better than pounding club music.",5.0
2,N6yQkZKiC3X_e-FwlgcaDA,"So we had a reservation for 6 at 5pm ....meg our server was very friendly - we had to ask for an extra setting - the entrees took an one hour and 15 minutes to come - very slow - we did have apps- the wine took a while to come - the busboy wasn't very friendly - no smiles - steak dish was cold - my seafood dish was pricey for a very small portion- as the dinner went along the service level got slower...one entree was under cooked - took over 10 minutes for it to be re delivered ...for the prices charge the level of service is lacking - portions are on the small side too-  I won't go back - the manager came by to ask about the re cooked entree but didn't offer anything nor did he say thanks for coming or ask about our food-

Over priced - poor service - average food-no real concern for the customer= I'm surprised how you stay in business....disappointing for almost $400 spent ....",1.0
3,u54_VZXfwBephz43qhjR3w,"Super hard option to beat.  You want old school Americanized Chinese food done right?  They've got that.   You want something a bit more upscale?  They've got that too.  Dim Sum?  They were one of the original Dim Sum places in Austin.  Sushi?  They've got a great sushi menu too.   Whether you want fried rice, Kung Pao chicken, or a variety of sushi, this is the place to go to have it done right.

Ronald Cheng is truly a first class restaurateur and his passion for all things Asian continues to shine.  Not only is Chinatown an Austin institution, the variety here beats the Asian fusion types at their own game.",4.0

6,-4-XERVROw271RJv2YRa1Q,"This Past winter, I experienced a rattling noise on starting my 2010 Prius.  It happen randomly several  times.  Recently,  I received a Warranty Enhancement Notification - ZF3 from Toyota regarding rough idle and/or rattle noise from the transaxle at cold start due to a sticking Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve. Ahh, I said, that sounds like my problem. I brought the car to Beaverton Toyota to have the EGR valve replaced on 9/29/16. Not surprising, they couldn't get the car to fail in 72 degree weather. The letter stated, ""the vehicle may illuminate the check engine light and set a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) P0401.""  The optimum work is MAY. If the dealer knows it MAY or MAY NOT trigger a failure code and the customer complains about cold starts then repair the vehicle.  I spoke with the warranty manager and customer service manager but they refused to repair the vehicle.  They said wait until the car fails and then they can repair it.  Who wants to wait until their cars fails to repair it.  That's why it's call PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. They sent me to Toyota Customer Relations but they sent me back to the dealer.",1.0
7,1vQYyhcb-rdvYCJprIY4zw,"Good 'ole T-Mac. Consistent and reliable, and that's what I like most about it. I've been eating at this establishment for years, and I really love their consistency between locations. 

On this last occasion, we came in before I worked an event in the area. I skipped lunch earlier because I was working, and needed good food fast. Plus, boyfriend wanted to watch the football game, and T-Mac definitely has enough screens to choose from.

I ordered the Sante Fe Wrap, which I've had before but not since they redid the menu. I didn't read the description correctly, and it came out with a ton of rice inside the wrap. And it was really thick, fluffy rice at that. I had to scrape a lot out because it became too starchy too quickly. But overall it was good and I ended up full before going to work.

Boyfriend got the wings, like he usually does. Another perk about T-Mac is they're really nice about letting you split sauces, even on small orders. And, this location has pretty good fry cooking techniques. The last location we went to, by Phillips Arena, gave us soggy fries.

My main complaint with the experience was the fact that I didn't get the hard cider I wanted; this is more on the POS/management side than an issue with our server. I asked for a seasonal Woodchuck, and the server brought me the traditional Amber instead. When we brought this to her attention, she said they don't sell a lot of the seasonal and it's not in the walk-in. So they don't have a button for it. So... why have it on the beer list if there's not a way for the server to ring it in correctly and for the bartender to pull the correct drink? Doesn't make sense. I wish I had brought it up to the manager while I was there.

Overall it's not a bad place. Good for watching sports and drinking a ton of different beers.",2.0
8,-BfQRRaqB5Ur7EMTPrRMXQ,"Since living in Orlando and being from Brooklyn, I have been on an endless search for good pizza. First rule of thumb Beware of any place that says NY Style Pizza. They are not good.  We decided to give this place a shot. The pizza looked good, was the right size, and was cooked just right. I did think that it was salty. Must have been the tomato sauce.

The virgin drink was $8 and they charged me TEN (!!!) additional to add the gin. This is highway robbery considering that the average price of the other cocktails on the menu was $14-$16.

You spend most of your time listen to Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt talk non-stop about the destructive power of tornadoes sprinkled in with footage from Twister... They do this in two separate sections. Sure, there's props from the show to see, but there's too much talking. Then it ends with a simulated tornado ripping through Small Town USA...

Ordered cheese pizza, and like all places exploiting the NY reference, it only served to disappoint. Flavorless. 

The place is large with a good size patio and they serve beer and wine so in the summer it might b a place to unwind with some friends. Inside could use some maintenance and updating but decent enough for a casual weeknight 'Italian' RN in the neighborhood. But if you're actually craving pizza, keep looking.",2.0
18,rh3ePx-hemfnvuC-FqvJnA,"The food may seem a little pricey for the pizza itself, but once you factor in the restaurant's ethos (pay and benefits for employees, quality sourced ingredients), it is worth it!

They also have sandwiches and salads, if you want to eat a bit lighter.",4.0
19,yIiIwdsUUhl6pN_ex1OgYA,"Chuco's is so close to my work, it has become one of my ""delicious-lazy-easy"" places to eat- meaning, the food only tastes good because of the proximity, price and portions. First off, I love greasy food. So their greasy chips thrilled me. Their chicken tacos were great, too, though I wouldn't call them ""greasy"", but they're not for health zombies, either. They are so big that I can turn one chicken taco into three by bringing my own tortillas to work. So in a nutshell I can walk to this place, buy one chicken taco, bring it back to work and turn it into three. It's so magical.

Now the downsides: 
Service is spotty. They always mess up an order placed over the phone. It seems like they are under-manned during the lunch rush. I agree with previous reviewers that often there is no one behind the counter and you kind of feel neglected. However, when they are there, they are VERY nice, and my food comes out quickly. 

Bottom Line: It's so cheap and convenient to folks in the west part of downtown that I would recommend it. For everyone else, I would have to say that I'm sure you have a similarly cheap and sub-par taco place closer to you, so don't waste your time coming to this place.",3.0

I got the veggie burger because the description sounded unique- and it did not disappoint! The fries were hot, salty and delicious, and I enjoyed dipping them in the ketchup, which almost tasted like it had some BBQ sauce mixed into it! I was tempted by the milkshake menu, but saved my dessert splurge for another place.

23,q1qL7yK7leZNLopv42Wkfg,"This was by far the worst timeshare experience! HORRIBLE customer service, we actually had some employees snap at us! We got snapped at by front desk because our plane was late so he wasn't sure if we could get booked into the room that we already paid for. Then scolded by the woman finishing up our reservation the next day. The dryer didnt work. I complained & was told that it just doesnt work well.... after 2.5hrs our clothes were still wet! My fridge broke, they came & turned the setting to ""coldest"" & called it fixed! It BROKE, settings cease to be relevant. They didnt come back to repair or replace itn just let me wait. W had to have security let us into our room 1-3 times per day. Security snapped at us & insisted that we put it next to our phone which we did not. Nobody smiles, it must suck to work there? Waiting for security & maintenance & having damp clothes laying across everything to dry, then having to repack, move to a different condo then unpack AGAIN wasted a full day of our trip. One employee (Ana Delis) cut me off & went off on me when I told her the problems with my condo. She basically told me to tell it to someone else, she isn't responsible for our condo problems but MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH RUDER!! This has been an absolute nightmare.

To me, there is nothing special about the food at high end steak houses.  It's all pretty much the same and isn't eactly inventive or inspired cooking.  But that's ok.  I know what I'm after when I go - a big hunk of high quality beef.  

Ergo, what it's really about is service...attention to detail.  I just didn't experience that at Fleming's.  I ordered a Martini with olives.  I got a drink with no garnish.  I asked for my steak with bernaise on the side.  I got no sauce.  I know these are nit picky details, but again I differentiate steak houses with the details.",2.0

My sister order was mistakenly mixed up and when we went ahead and told our server her response was ""Well that was what I understood"" I kindly asked if she can correct it and her response was ""It'll take a while before the food comes out sooo..?""

Our chips tasted old and the guacamole was not fresh. We asked to change it and she practically brought out the same batter with the remark of ""This was freshly made today and it's all that we have""

I said but my tire is going flat and needs repaired. again he said we are not taking anymore customers. Now there were other customers there and I realize they would come first, but all he had to say was i have people ahead of you but i will get your tire fixed since its going flat.( aka customer service).  Luckily there was a tire Kingdom around the corner and they were cleaning up and getting ready to close for the night. They said no problem we will fix it for you. They jumped right on it and fixed my tire which had a 4 inch bolt/screw  in it and they had to take the tire off the rim to fix it. They never once complained and were so much more professional.

I have never had exceptional service..sometimes you get a smile, like as your getting off the plane. I One time i flew with my 6 month old son, who unfortunatly, spit-up all over me, mid-flight, after I fed him.  I stood up to use the front bathoom of the place, not knowing it was occupied.  A flight attendant came rushing at me and I was told I had to return to my seat, b/c 911 regulations state the front cock-pit can not be blocked by a passenger.    (Did I look like I was going to hi-jack a plane, with a 6-month old in my arms covered in baby vomit?)   However, I understand the policy, and apoligized, b/c I really didn't realize it was occupied.   She told me that I could use the back bathroom, but tht I had to return to my seat after.   She huffed and turned away from me, and rolled her eyes at the other flight attendant.   I was annoyed, but hey, we live in different times now.    I understand their strict policies, i didn't think it warrented her rudeness.    But, the last time I flew I was yelled at by a SW employee in the Orlando airport.  My husband was in the baggage claim office, b/c we were missing 1 piece of luggage.   I was standing outside the office with my 3 pieces of luggage a1 year-old in a stroller, and 3 year-old.  They were hungry, and tired.    My 3 year old- wanted to be with his Dad.  He ran away from me, and I ran after him, but I tripped over my luggage.  Yes, i am clumsy.   He opened the door and ran into the office before I could get him. Well, he almost pinched his finger on the door, and an Employee of SW held the door open for him.  I yelled thank-you to her and said ""he's fast, I couldn't get to him in time.""   She turned and glared at me.  She said He could have hurt himself in the door.   I just looked at her.  She then walked over to me, put her finger in my face, and again, said,  ""you better watch your kids closley, what kind of mother let's her child get away from her? he could have hurt hemself.""   I was shocked.  A woman next to me who witnessed it, actully said that it wasn't my fault, that I tried to go after him.    Her husband asked the employee if she had kids.  The SW employee looked at me and walked away.  She then went into the Baggage claim office and told another employee about what happened.  The whole time pointing at me.

I've been here a few times for drinks and once for food, and I always leave pretty happy. The cocktail list is great, with tons of (changing) creative and delicious drinks usually priced betwen $7.50 and $8.50 -- pretty reasonable considering the quality of cocktail.

They do seem a bit slow with drinks - but I've only been here when it's been fairly busy and ordered drinks in the dining room, I'd assume you get faster service sitting at the bar.

The food is very tasty, somewhat upscale fare. I had the spicy clam stew and sampled some of a friend's gnocchi (prepared vegetarian by request with absolutely no drama) and both were quite good.

The pulled pork was great but the bread could not support nor compliment the sandwich.  It literally turned to mush on the bottom and was inedible.  I did however wolf down the pulled pork which was delicious.  The bread ruined the sandwich.  The same was true for my wife's sandwich which was chicken tips.  Part of the problem could be that the sandwiches are served in a plastic basket lined with a piece of paper that also turns soggy along with the bread.  Too bad.

I had the small combo wings/drums in half spicy and half soy garlic. Both tasted amazing and the crispy-ness of the wings were on a whole new level from what I've had before. I have to give the prize to the spicy flavor, it's really good and not really that spicy.

The pita was warm and the hummus was truly delicious and it was quickly followed our sandwiches.  Disappointment #2.  They were very small, about 4"" in circumference, and wrapped like burritos on warm, but dry, tortillas.  I guess we shouldn't have assumed our sandwiches would be wrapped in pita bread?  Wrong.  My husband said his beef doner meat tasted okay, but was dry as there was no condiment whatsoever and the situation with my chicken wrap was virtually the same.  Mine was supposed to have a tomato sauce but did not have any, or any other condiment, until the last bite, literally.  Pretty dumb.  Once I noticed its lack of the tomato sauce with the first bite, I tried explaining that to our server, but she has some difficulty with English, so I then asked if I could just have a little bit of mayo on the side.

I transferred into my lease and this was suppose to be a nice place to relocate after being in dorms...very wrong. within the three years, I have had plenty of issues. When i first moved in, the apartment was dirty and I had to have them come out and clean it after much debate. Oh and replace the sofa since it smelled of urine. But they wouldn't replace the chair in the living room that had holes in the fabric. Mind you I had already signed the lease before seeing this place and was now stuck. I experience a leaking dishwasher that took over 3months for them to replace while they took their time on deciding if to replace it completely or buy the replacement cap...after the 3months they just replaced it(I called about weekly because no one could tell me anything of what was going on). With that leaking dishwasher came wet kitchen floors that had to be replaced...which was half assed replaced and poorly done(made them come out two more times...never really got fixed..I actually glued tiles myself). I told off one girl in the office named Sheila because the maintenance staff were coming in the apartment unannounced and couldn't tell me what they were doing ( on the simple fact they can't speak english and also when i called they asked if they fixed the problem..I actually hadn't put in any maintenance requests)..she rudely hung up on me and I therefore had to call back and give a piece of my mind. When i got ahold of the manager and regional manager, all they did was apologize...somewhat... Besides those issues, I've had bug issues and had them have to come out to fix my toilet four times after it kept not flushing..mind you if you fix it the first time it should work..they actually didn't fix it right the first time...and took their time each time...i had to call back after putting maintenance request to see if it would be done. Whenever you put a maintenance request in, call back within an hour to see if it actually got put in, half the time they say they will but there will be no record of it later..(they actually dont put them in half the time). Most of the staff is lazy and can never seem to do their job. I was going to move out last year but couldnt get anyone to transfer lease with..sadly..so i was stuck. they have a short window of cancelling your lease so be careful.

Their portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. 

Their bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. 

Their pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them.

The shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in.

I generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks.

Unfortunately, their service is atrocious.  Expect delivery orders to take about an hour and a half or more.  Take out is equally as inefficient, as we've waited more than 30 minutes (on top of the 30 minutes they told us it would take).  They also very rarely get our orders right.  You wouldn't think that a Greek Salad could be messed up, but it almost always is.

It was a little tight as far as seating went but we were a large group, so I get it. However, my biggest gripe came at the end of the meal. As we were waiting for the bill 2 people who were waiting to be seated came up to our table and very rudely asked if we were done eating. They stated that they were from out of town (it's Austin, everyone is from out of town) and they had been waiting to be seated for 2 hours (they decided to show up in the afternoon, on a Saturday, at a trendy restaurant). There were plenty of other people waiting outside and none of them were complaining. As this was happening none of the staff bothered to intervene. That was where the visit went south for me. There should have been someone from the staff stepping in to help these people out and make sure that we could wait for our bill without being harassed. My advice for anyone wanting to visit this place is to enjoy the atmosphere, the food, and drinks but just make sure you eat fast to avoid being harassed by impatient out of towners.",2.0

I highly recommend the KFC combo! They use an entire chicken (~17 pieces) and you also get a pitcher of beer of your choice. They offer a couple of sauces (some to dip, some you can toss). Tip: you can ask them to toss half of it in one sauce and the other half plain or in another sauce! The chicken tossed in Korean sweet and spicy is my fav. They also give you a side dish of picked daikon radish. I wish they gave us more side dishes! It's free so I really can't complain. I've also tried their kimchi bulgogi fries and liked it! It's not the same as chilantro's but it's still very tasty. They have other dishes like the military pot which I've heard good things about. 

The server is incredibly sweet. I always talk about him when I bring my friends to college roadhouse. I've been a couple of times already and always enjoy my experience here. They have karaoke rooms if you are interested in that.

103,mOPkeA0RCHzsz-zCFVy9dA,"Moved to the Melrose area back in June and spent the summer months looking for a new home gym. I tried the closest Planet Fitness and WOW locations and found they were GROSSLY overpopulated. Getting a machine at either location wasn't at all possible at peak times, so I went to meet with Camille and Josh to tour Anytime Fitness in September. After seeing the open availability of machines, and the ""anytime"" access, I was sold. Even though the space may be smaller than the big box gyms, the availability of access spreads the ""busy times"" throughout the day where there's never a crowd when you decide to go. I've never had an issue getting a machine or weight when I need to and I am a regular visitor (probably not as regular as I should be, thanks for pointing that out!). The demographic of members is very easy going. No ""gym-rats"" or kids, every one is very respectful and clean which is key in a gym for me. 

Equipment set up here is perfect for me. It's got everything I could want to use from treadmills and bikes, to free weights and a good variety of machines to work out in any manner I could want. Management is also very accommodating to requests for new equipment and services and encourage members to come up with new suggestions. I have left a suggestion or two on the chalkboard, which is a nice touch. It sort of ""personalizes"" the gym for me. Very rare nowadays.

For any place I give 5-stars to, I force myself to also list a ""con"" just to show I am not TOTALLY brainwashed :), and the only thing I could think of here, and it's prevalent in a lot of gyms I have noticed, is a lack of WiFi availability I guess? Besides that, I can't find anything I haven't liked about being a member of Anytime Fitness. I look forward to being a renewing customer next year.

EDIT: 12/14/12

I am leaving the above review untouched so people can see what I typed originally. I don't believe in going back and changing the original review. But went into Anytime Fitness today to find a pleasant surprise.. they've added WiFi to the gym after a couple of us made the suggestion.

112,RlilM1gXxmjFrHifubdKsw,"We visited Garden Grill for the Seafood buffet on Thursday, April 5th on the last night of our Spring Break vacation.  We had about $200 left on our Disney Rewards Redemption card from CHASE Visa and wanted to go somewhere where we could use as much of that money as possible before we left the next day.  We called to make a reservation and I explained the situation and was told that Garden Grill does not participate in Disney's dining plan but they do accept the Disney Rewards Redemption card.

Once we arrived, we were seated promptly and made our first trip to try buffet.  My son got chicken tenders and we asked our waiter for some ketchup for them.  He was busy but we saw him come back out 3 other times in which we tried to get his attention while my 8 year old sat waiting to eat.  Finally, after about 12 minutes we walked across the dining room and took a bottle from another empty table so that he could finally eat.

After we returned with our first plate, we were told that each paying adult gets half a stuffed lobster but they ""make them quickly"" so when we finished our first plate, to let our waiter know and he would have them to us quickly.  From the time that we let him know we were ready to the time they were delivered was 21 minutes by my watch.  

As many other reviews have noted the crab legs were overcooked and rubbery and the seafood buffet selection as a whole left much to be desired.  We asked for our check about an hour and 15 minutes after we started (which is an eternity for a buffet) and when our $140 bill arrived joked, at least the meal was free since we had these last 200 redemption dollars to use.

After we gave our card to the waiter, he returned to let us know that despite what we had been told when making the reservation the Garden Grill does not accept Disney Redemption cards.  The Manager, Shelby came over and apologized to us and said that the Swan hotel has no way to charge the Disney Redemption cards and that we would instead have to pay out of pocket.  Her only consolation was if we knew who we had spoken to when we made the reservation, she would speak to them to make sure she knew that the Garden Grill does not take these Disney Redemption cards.  

Obviously, we only came to the restaurant because we wanted to use the last of our ""free"" money and could have gone to any number of the different Disney restaurants that do accept the cards if we were told correctly that he Garden Grill was not able to take them.  Had I not specifically asked about using the card and then we came to find out we couldn't use it, I still would have been very disappointed but on some level it would have been my responsibility for not checking before.  In this case, I did ask and was told specifically by a Disney employee that we could use the card.  Despite that, we had the double whammy of not being able to use the final $200 we had saved from our Disney Rewards card and also having to pay out of pocket an additional $140 for a meal we didn't feel was up to Disney's usual standards.

Had we not had the payment issue at the end of the meal, I would have given Garden Grill 2 Stars for the meal itself and the service, but when Customer Service is factored in, I'm giving my first ever 1 star review on Trip Advisor.  

I understand mistakes happen and people misspeak or are sometimes misinformed but for Disney, a company that is world known for their outstanding customer service to essentially shrug their shoulders at a situation in which their employees mistake cost us $140 was beyond disappointing.",1.0

We went there for a quick bite before the movie started. I ordered the hazelnut pasta (added chicken) and DH ordered a burger and had the Apple crisp (or strudel... some apple thing). We had it delivered to the movie (living room theater at Cinetopia right next door) which was totally cool.

They forgot to add chicken to the pasta (but we got charged for it but it was too late since it was delivered already) and forgot salt as well. A small child could have probably prepared the pasta better. Without some salt, the dish was bland. DH said the burger was okay. The apple crisp tasted like it came out of a cardboard box.

 However i still do not suggest rouge as a place to go if you are fair skinned and are looking for a natural look. 50 dollars to get your makeup applied when the girl doesnt even listen to what you really want is unfair. It seems like alot of the people on here have had a good experience however i dont know what type of makeup they wear. Most people that go to get their makeup done want to look very done up. otherwise why not just do it at home. I guess if u are doing wedding makeup (although id really like to see an example of nautural makeup done for a wedding...maybe you guys could post some pics on your websites of a few different skin types.) then its an ok place to go. ALL i was saying is when i ask for no foundation and just coverup on any redness and undereye circles and just blush and mascara...DONT insist and then without my permission draw on pinup like eyebrows and a cateye as thick as my pinky finger. I just felt like i had no say in what i wanted and for 50 dollars i should be able to get whatever i want. Maybe the girl who did my makeup doesnt work there anymore as it seems the owners take their trade very seriously. In no way was i saying anyone was mean or unproffesional but being in the nursing field i know that the patient/customer is always right so if i am paying for you to do my makeup and u have every color and everytype of palate to work with why not take the time to make sure your customers are happy. I was completley rushed through my appointment. i am a very nice patient person but i left there soooo dissapointed in a place that had me sooo excited to go to.Its very pretty and clean in there.

Also be prepared for the LACK of free parking......However, the restaurant does offer valet...so do it...trust me. Also I recommend dressing nice here...it's a bit above your casual dress.

Went here for a girl's night and ordered the following:
Gruyere biscuits - solid awesome. Get those freaking biscuits. They are worth it. 

Fries w/truffle oil- good reminds me of umami fries in CA but not to die for personally. Just do it to try once for the experience
Ravioli that day was not that great or worth it. Come here for meat. No pun intended.

  * The cost is now $9.99 for dinner. 
  * Their bottled beer prices now top out at $1.99 (imports, including Asian), with domestics at $1.79.
  * The mussels are good because they're not encased in cheese. 
  * The steamed salmon is better than at most buffets. 
  * Some of the meat combination dishes can be too salty for some people's taste. 
  * The service is good & not very intrusive. 
  * The desserts don't look very appetizing, but this is fairly common to Oriental buffets, for some reason. But, the ice cream is one of those vanilla/chocolate /swirl deals,  and there's a decent selection of toppings. 

OK...so that warrants 3 stars on my grading scale.

The audacity of that poster who thinks those of us who have been insulted by the rude staff are placing ""worthless"" reviews.  Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated?  His ""great"" service does not make ours any less authentic or real.   The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise. Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful. No, it's not their fault it's everyone else's. Yeah right!   Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect, courtesy, and kindness. I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance!  Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly!!  Point, Blank, and Period.  If Costello's do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff.  That is what good business people do!! I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day?  Are you fkn kidding me?  When you are in the ""hospitality"" business you be hospitable regardless of what you have to deal with and what kind of day you are having.  Unbelievable!!   

If you want to be treated well by staff and have GREAT food and quality service  and drinks then I strongly suggest you walk ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GALWAY HOUSE!   They also make an excellent dirty martini!  Bartenders and staff are super friendly.  

Now on to the original review:

I haven't been to this place in years.  So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band. I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender.  I am talking MAJOR attitude.  If you don't like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work.  Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me.  I won't ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side.  The male bartender was much more friendlier!   If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when she's working.  Very disrespectful.  You don't disrespect and give attitude to the f**&n customers and expect tips!! 

I ended up leaving there and going to Coco's Lounge. The hospitality shown at CoCo's lounge by the owner was exceptional.  Very friendly.  The waitresses had a smile, spoke to you with respect, and the service was fast!  The patrons were nice and the latin music was good.  Much better experience  I must say.  When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude! 

Period!!

If anyone knows the owner/s of Costello's PLEASE let Me know via email.  I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isn't a relation.  They need better staff.  Hell I'll work there and give the patrons service with a f**^n smile!!!",1.0
141,CcIbl8FgX4VyNkS5Qw2BMQ,"Wow! I'm surprised at how many people have such a lack of knowledge on what tastes good and what a good burrito is. Let me start by saying this is the second time I've been here. I really wanted to like this place coming from California, I love burritos and this place happens to be right in front of where I live. I didn't want to write a negative review after my first experience (which was horrible), so I decided to give it a second shot. First time I was here, I had the chicken burrito. It was so bland. If you're going to put rice and beans in all your burritos, make sure they're well seasoned. Their onions are just very huge sloppy chunks. I felt like I was just biting into onions. For my second visit, I decided to go with their popular pork and Chile burrito, chicken quesadilla, nachos with the meat chili and guacamole. Burrito was once again super bland. Half of it didn't even have any meat in it, I thought they accidentally made the vegetarian one. Once I got to the meat, it was once again flavorless... the nachos came out with no meat chili which I had to pay $4 something extra for (good thing I checked my box before I left). The quesadilla was super soggy and dripping with liquid. The guac was under seasoned and didn't even have cilantro in it. Just overall another horrible experience. Anyone who says this place is good, is not a good person to ask for food recommendations. You're better off going to Taco Bell.",1.0

Regardless, the meal was delightful! Of especial greatness was the Paella, the Patatas Bravas, and THE FLAN! Oh, the flan! Through some culinary magic, it was like they'd married flan to your favorite cinnamon breakfast cereal. Delicious! We also had their Churros and Chocolate Mousse, both of which were good, but they were plainly outclassed by the Flan.

Service was excellent and of special note was the brilliant idea to have a cook stationed outside the restaurant making the paella in a giant pan by the front doors. It added to the atmosphere and spread the smell of the food through the area, and that guy was the hero of the restaurant.

One final note: the chorizo they use was house-made and more tender and delicious than I've generally found Spanish chorizo to be.",4.0

- Alex, our server. She was extremely attentive and friendly.
- Atmosphere. It was hip enough for SoCo or any large urban city.
- Beer Selection. A refined selection of micro brews.
- Chipolte Catsup. Home made goodness, not too sweet just the right amount of heat.
- Chile Cheese. We used it for a dipping sauce for our burgers... YUM.
- Camaraderie of our fellow diners waiting in the ""40 min"" queue. It was fun to strike up a conversation about how this dining experience was starting to feel like an ""E"" ticket ride at Disney - there is something GREAT at the of this line and we will be reward for our patiences.

We really wanted to like our whole dining experience at Hopdoddy but the burgers unfortunately were dry and the accompanying veggies did not maintain their expected crispness. The queuing concept a la ""Fuddruckers"" could have been more effective if there were more than 2 smiling faces waiting to take your order. When we arrived this past Saturday night, we told the wait just order our food would be 40 mins, we were steps from the front door (.... and I ""know""..... what was I expecting, it is SATURDAY night  for god's sake). Luckily, the queue flows past the bar where you are able pick up drink while waiting. 
And so like any good troopers, we made the best of our experience  focusing on the all of the things we enjoy about our evening - chatting it up with the people in the queue, marveling at the creative way an 8 top table could be transformed to accommodate a combination of various sized dining parties by merely moving a panel that resembled a large chalk board establishing a new line of demarcation, the amazing Chile Cheese sauce, and the fact we did try someplace new for dinner.",2.0

Appetizer : Really good fried pickles... And that says a lot from me because I don't like pickles outside of a hamburger bun! 

Meal:  Vanbarry's Bacon Jam burger. The burger was perfectly cooked (rare-medium). The beef was high quality. The bacon jam has kind of a sweetness that offset the bacon's salty side. Kind of a caramelized taste. The blue cheese was perfect with it. I decided to try the sweet potato salad as my side,  because I've never heard of it. It was really sweet and creamy. It was really tasty but not quite as chunky as I prefer for my potato salad. The flavor was great and I'd definitely have it again. 

Oh, the beer was cold and good too! :-)  

As an aside,  the band/singer was really good! Kind of a Dave Matthews type. Great voice. I missed his name but I told my wife thst I could see making Sundays on the open patio a regular event to listen to enjoy the music and food.

171,S3p3z56rSuWBKkfDD6ps1g,"Unos is actually my favorite restaurant and yet it's come to this--a two star review.  This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.

I came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  

Then, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, ""no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here"" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded ""No, that would be the same thing"", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for ""get me out of here please! NOW."", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. 

My whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.

I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service.

I hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. 

Tried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was!

For what it is, El Chilito's not too bad--if Mi Madre's is closed (it generally closes at 2pm), then El Chilito will suffice in a pinch.  Their cochinita pibil is pretty tasty, as is their tomatillo pork.  Their barbacoa, unfortunately, tastes nothing like authentic barbacoa.. it's dry and chewy and not even shredded, wtf?  Their breakfast tacos with chorizo are light on the chorizo and heavy on the eggs.  I believe they use El Milagro tortillas, which means they're very good tortillas, but I think El Chilito either lets them sit around too long or doesn't soften them up somehow before slapping the fillings in.  Probably both.  The last tortillas I got there had very dry, stale edges which is a pet peeve of mine.

That said, ordering a cochinita pibil, a tomatillo pork, and a glass of sangria is a cheap, tasty, and effective hangover-helper... so props to El Chilito for that.",2.0

First of all, the menu didn't match the order sheet and when I asked the server, she said the menu is old and the sheet is correct.  Why not update the menu?

Second of all, not all the items we ordered were served.  When the server came to check to see if we were done, we informed her that we were still waiting on a few items.  She didn't say anything and walked away.  After waiting for another 10 minutes, we decided to just get the check.

The bill came and the total was $29.30.  We gave them $35.00 and the server just assumed that was the tip as well and didn't give us any change.  When we asked, she was super annoyed and brought back the change.  It's not cool to just assume how much I will be tipping.

183,_cVlKd4nWlDCjD1ALH1ieQ,"I'm writing this review to tell a tale of my experience here.  I used to visit this store frequently for myself.  It was fun and well priced.  However, maybe about 4 years back things changed.  You used to go in and snag a half way decent chair, desk, or sofa regardless if it was newish or had a ""label"" for about $75.  The furniture back then was really reasonable.  I understand that they wanted to keep the antique dealers at bay and this may be the reason why the prices spiked, however, in doing so they have basically increased the price for all including those people who really are in need.  I now go in and look at the furniture and a housewares and feel really angry that some unsuspecting person will go in and pay $300 for a used piece of furniture in thinking that they are getting a good deal.  Not so,  it's better to go to a discount furniture store (Building 19 or even Bob's) and buy new for $350.  I thought the purpose of the store was to help those who couldn't afford new have something nice, not to rip them off.  So the antique dealers aren't buying in there hardly anymore (they used to swarm around the trucks unloading on Friday night) but now the people who don't have a lot of money can't happen upon a great deal too.  I don't know how extensive the antique dealers would buy and resell, but it would appear as though there is a bigger profit happening at Sally Ann.  Is that money really going towards the programs they have and not into someone's pocket?  I rarely if ever visit this store anymore.",2.0

Walked in to be ignored by valet/doorman.  Hostess looks out from under her eye lids and huffs ""its going to be at LEAST and hour for two"".  Say no problem, we're here now and happy at the bar for the wait.  Hostess says that two people are leaving the bar tables and they are first come first serve.  We say that's just as great and promptly seat ourselves at the dirty table.  Bus boys come and clean it up, present water and bread - and I go to the bathroom.  While I was in the bathroom the bartender has come over and taken a drinks and app order.  My husband ordered a house pinot for me and a traditional Bud for himself.  He said the bartender kept trying to upsell him on Sam Adams and it felt really awkward to decline.  My main complaint about this place was the service received.  All around us people were being treated nicely - things would go wrong with their order, they'd complain and yell and get comped.  Meanwhile the table for two, being quiet and courteous, happy with their order -is made to feel they are not good enough to sit in the BAR at a chain restaurant filled with tourists. The bartender would have had his easiest table of the night and easy tip if he JUST took a SECOND to acknowledge us as fellow humans.  What a dick.  Typical only brings out the smile when presenting the check - and of course as I suspected has charged us $15 for the ""house"" wine which was actually the most expensive pinot.  DICK!

I hate leaving a review like this, but I'd rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, I'm German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we weren't even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didn't have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. 
I asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didn't even know what cafe con leche was??? 
We both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally ""drizzled"" a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. 
There is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! 
We both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!!

Talk about leaving yourself totally exposed to a bank account drain!!!  But I have faith, and the other reviews tell it true.  These guys are honest and trustworthy, and really made me (and my daughter) feel like they cared about our situation.  What a surprise to find out it was only like $100 for all their work.  I'm already talking to Steve about my next repairs.

    NO matter if a customer is on the phone or has ten screaming children, it is YOUR job to make them feel welcome. It is NOT your job to be pretentious and treat the customers walking into your business without respect.  

    The people that choose to walk through the door and get coffees and such..... PAY YOUR PAYCHECK !! Try performing the basics of your job, Mr. Cashier, and read the guests order back to them before they pay, then you wouldn't have to make snide comments.

Very reasonably priced at $6.50 for the chow fun and cold milk tea combo.

A mature and well-reasoned response, surely.  Please read my detailed, specific review below.  Note that I am in no way affiliated with any competing business; I live an hour away and was visiting friends for the weekend.  

***

I was very disappointed in the haunted corn maze. I know the farm can't control the weather, but regardless, they were still charging full price for a maze where 3/4 of the corn was laid down by the wind.  It wasn't so much a maze as an open field of mud and darkness, covered in 2-3 inches of water and knee-high corn stalks.  It was very slippery and generally miserable; it didn't seem like any effort had been made to mitigate the mud (no hay or barkdust or anything visible under the water).  Definitely not suitable for children or the elderly.    

The ticket lady told me that their real haunted maze had been flooded earlier in the day, so they were doing the scary stuff in their standard maze.  If that was the better-condition of the two mazes, then the other one must have been a literal swimming pool.

Every staff member I interacted with seemed overworked and snotty (with the exception of the people doing the scaring IN the maze - they were all great and making the best of a bad situation).  One parking attendant directed me to a handicapped parking area (not marked as such) and then yelled at me when I parked there.  A different attendant raised her voice and took a very sarcastic tone with my girlfriend for failing to stay on the ""pedestrian path"" through the parking lot (it was dark and poorly marked; there was no need for her tone).  The girl speaking over the PA system to make announcements sounded like the most bored, sarcastic teenager stereotype imaginable.  There was no attempt to create a festive or fun atmosphere. 

I also have to wonder at their decision to blast modern pop music over the PA system in the main area, because it carries over into the haunted maze and really ruins what little atmosphere remained.

Since I assume that the corn won't magically stand itself back up after the wind storm, and I doubt that they'll be replacing their entire staff between now and Halloween, I would definitely skip this maze for the rest of the year.  I have heard that there are other locations on the same road, and I would definitely try one of those first, because they can't be any worse than Bella Organic Farm.",1.0

The Schlesinger:  Warm banana nut bread served open faced with melted Monterey Jack cheese and thinly sliced ham. Sided with a banana mango chutney and purple cabbage slaw.

Sounds enticing for an adventurous eater, no?

NO.  Just no.  It did not work at all.  To be fair, the banana bread itself was quite yummy... but it just did NOT work with the cheese or ham.  And definitely did not work with the chutney, which was extremely over-spiced and overpowered the delicate flavor of the banana bread.  The cabbage salad was pretty good.  But when I was done, it occured to me that I had just eaten banana bread for dinner and immediately start craving something savory.  Like green beans.

It offers a convenient spot not only for its patrons, but also passers-by who walk around the Mall and in fact some walk by the opposing balcony by the escalator where there is clear view of the huge wall projector screen, therefore, a perfect viewing angle from EVERY angle during a game.  Also good for hotel guests, train commuters who cut through the mall to catch the Orange Line, etc.  

Champions had been renovated a few years back and their bar especially offers colorful and vibe and atmosphere to their patrons.  The several TVs, their wall projector add to the excitement during a game.

Hostess then arrives at our table and hands us two menus. Ten minutes go by and we haven't been waited on or checked in on by any one. Two gentlemen enter--are immediately seated and waitress brings them water. 20 minutes now go by. Restaurant is filling up (we know this because we are sitting in the middle of the room--front row seats). At this point we are hungry and pretty annoyed. My friend tries to flag down a waitress and she, without exaggeration, ignores her and continues on her way.

My wife and I had the raspberry glaze, the lemon poppyseed and the chocolate crunch. In fairness, the chocolate crunch was actually pretty good but the chocolate was a little bitter for me. But that's me. However the other two were both really dry.

I was very excited about their Groupon deal. So I called to schedule an appointment, telling them that I was using the Groupon. It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later, and her attitude was not so pleasant. Then, she said she would email me a registration package soon. But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment. So I completed it and sent it back immediately. Later, she did not remind me about the appointment again. I had a very bad day before the appointment, so unfortunately I forgot about it.

When I called to reschedule, I apologized several times, and her attitude was still not so pleasant. She said, ""You cannot reschedule until you pay us the $50 cancellation fee. It says that on the website. I don't know where, but you can go find it."" You don't know where?! Because you never told me/possibly anyone about it?! $50 was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for!

So I said, ""When there is a cancellation policy, my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment."" She said, ""Well, we do it two days before."" No, she did not do that either. So I found another dentist. They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called.

331,yfKLNhXYcFSuRxDnMULcPQ,"Went for a late Saturday night dinner with my boyfriend last month before Christmas.  We were enjoying a little ""staycation"" and had checked into the W hotel for the night. After a relaxing afternoon of massages at Bliss we made a reservation for 10:00 at Maggiano's up the block.  When we arrived it was bustling with Christmas parties, Birthday celebrations, and groups groups groups.  Definitely not the most romantic couples setting, but we were fine and welcomed the energy and fun company.  However the service was pretty abysmal. 

We checked in right on time for our reservation and the host told us it would be a short wait. We asked if we should get a drink at the bar and he said no no no you'll be seated very shortly. So we shifted to the side allowing others to come and go, and we waited...and waited....and waited some more.  After about 10 minutes we shifted about 3 feet to the bar which was not very crowded at all. There we waited....and waited...and waited again although the bartender was not busy at all.  Finally I shouted out my order for a Stella draft and he snapped out of it, brought me my beer, and took my guys' order.  We drank our beers and still, no table?  Eventually after over 25 minutes I went up to the Host again and asked what was up?  He looked perplexed and then realized he had given our table to someone else in error.  You know mistakes happen but we were standing right in front of him and I tried to make eye contact half a dozen times but he never once looked away from his computer screen or from chatting with colleagues. 

We got a brief apology and were finally seated.  Luckily we were in such a good mood we didn't let the past half hour get in our way of a good time.  But here's where the real fun begins.  We were sat in the middle of it all.  Parties all around us but we didn't mind, though my bf had to move his seat every two minutes for waiters to get through as we were apparently sat in their immediate line of traffic.  We did however mind the fact that we had to wait over 10 minutes to order drinks, another ten + to order our entrees, another 15 to receive.  And what was put in front of us was the saltiest food either of us had ever tasted.  I like salty food but my pasta dish was INEDIBLE.  By this time it's after 11, the crowds have thinned out and there are teams cleaning up all around us preparing to close down.  When the waiter came to clear our plates and saw I hadn't eaten my meal he did ask why and after politely telling him it was too salty, he took the pasta off the bill which we did not ask for but we did appreciate it.  
In the end we experienced really bad service and were fine with shrugging our shoulders and chalking it up to the busy holiday season, but the fact that our salads, app, and entrees were unimpressive and overly salty really added insult to injury.  The good news?  I was planning on having a heavy Italian feast, but I end consuming very little food, which is much better for my waistline :-)",1.0

1) Install a door for the kitchen/prep area. We had a full view of servers scraping dinner plates into orange Home Depot buckets and it was unappealing.

This is small... But 2) offer tortillas with your migas or southwest dishes. I paid extra for fresh avocado in my dish and I get it, avocado is expensive but I'm glad I did because if I didn't add this green item, then my dish would have been a white plate of food (unappetizing!).

We chose this place because its a brand new Japanese restaurant in Gastown and we liked the menu style from our Yelp reviews. When we arrived, I was surprise with modern decors with the theme of white background and dark furniture. The staff were friendly and informative and our server even spent a bit time on the menu with us because of the seasonal charges to the ingredients they use. That night, we ordered the Teba, Anabo, Lamu and couple of sushi. Overall everything were freshly make to order, but taste wise, not up to the standard compare to the dishe's price. For example, the sushi dishes were told to have wasabi and soy sauce in the sushi itself. Well, the chef, of course, put too much sauce and little wasabi and he kind of ruined the freshness of the fish ( To my taste anyway). The Anabo, the tempura eel ""box"" sushi dishes, was a disappointed to me. First, the eel was overcooked slightly and it was not a great combine with  the sauce and the rice. Overall, it was like a piece of fried fish placed on top of the rice and crumbled when you tried to pick up with a pair of chopshick. Lastly, the Lamu, roast lamb with grill vegetables. This dish was the only one of the many dishes that I was impressed. The meat was fresh and moist and it goes well with the vegetables and sauce. The only negative side was the lamb was not trimmed properly, too much fatty trims. 
The service was not bad, great service with great attitude server, just a little understand for the place.

This place is big enough for large groups, since they do have a private room in the back, unfortunately the room we reserved couldn't be used because the heater didn't work and I definitely wasn't trying to keep warm from the Korean BBQ grill. But it's ok though because they found us another spot and the manager brought us a couple of pitchers of cucumber Soju (whats a bday without alcohol, especially free!?!). It was surprisingly refreshing, because I am by all means not a fan of Soju, but we'll take what we can get!

With a party of 15, we were able try a variety of things this place has to offer from the BBQ to the sushi. For BBQ we ordered the beef bugolgi, beef short ribs, and pork stomach as well as a medley of vegetables to be grilled. For sushi we ordered basically every special roll they had and they have a lot of variety. The BBQ was fresh no dark spots on the meat, no complaints there, but nothing out of this world.

I usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. 

Okay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. 

They guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. 

Here's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. ""You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here."" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. 

Oh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.",5.0

We went in between 4 and 4:30 and there were no other diners there.  The server took our order and then she and the cook just hung around the front counter---he on his phone most of the time.  There seemed to be no action going on in the kitchen at all.  We ordered the dolmades for an appetizer and they were very good but tiny and overpriced at 5 for $6.95.  Then we waited and waited---still no action in the kitchen.  The server never checked on us.  Finally, the meal appeared (we are still the only diners In the place ). My daughters chicken kabob was so dry that she had to ask for some yogurt to dip it in and my little meat patties were so hard that I could hardly cut them.  Right before we were served we heard a timer go off, so considering the lack of action in the kitchen and the condition of the meat and chicken, I think they must have just reheated the entree.  The rest of the plate consisted of plain white rice and some garden salad greens with a basic vinaigrette dressing.  The server never came back after we were served.  When She brought the checkmentioned to her how dry the chicken was, she said--""oh, really?""  This was around $40.00 with tip and we left extremely unsatisfied.  Not worth the calories or the money.  It's hard to believe that we were in the same place with all the rave reviews about the food and service.



Thank you for your reply.  Evidently our experience was not the average because the reason we visited Troy was because of the good reviews.  That's why we were so surprised and disappointed by the unappetizing food and poor service.  I accept your explanation that the meat and chicken were cooked to order but, still, the chicken was extremely dry and the little meat patties were hard and tough.

But! 
Reasons I like Catch Air:

1) Great way to get your child to become utterly exhausted!
2) Versatile play equipment! 
3) It's clean! 
4) Various creepy mascots come out and dance with the kids! 
5) Glow-In-the-Dark, Black Out dance parties every hour! Rave on! 

I love that all the equipment is great for all different ages. There is a ""fenced off"" area for smaller children under 3. It's filled with little merry-go-rounds, small slides, ball pit and padded area for babies to crawl. 

There's also a jungle themed area for the slightly larger children filled with multiple slides, ball pit, air gun room, and much more. 

There's also a dance floor that lights up! This is where the basis of al the glow-in-the-dark dance parties take place! Parents and care givers can feel transported back into their rave days...but without the drugs ;) 

There is also a small inflatable with obstacles. And there's a giant slide inflatable as well. And, parents can go down the slide with their children!

There are also two interactive touch screen TV's that have various games for children on them everyday. And music is constantly blasting! 

Catch Air also offers food, snacks and beverages for purchase. So, outside food and drinks are frowned upon :(  And socks are a must!

Also, very secure and safe environment! Parent must fill out electronic waiver before entering. Both parent and child are stamped that match one another's and are matched up before leaving. And the front area with desk/shoe cubbies, and play area are separated by a small wall, so it's hard for anyone to slip out unnoticed. 

So, have fun and expect to get exhausted!",4.0
361,HQ5BdjIOCmJsweg2R0alWQ,"I've been for brunch a few times, but I'm sort of meh about brunch. Just don't really eat pancakes and all that stuff, and they do a nice job with two eggs, but it's not exactly something I would get crazy enough to write a review about.
Then I needed a last minute place for dinner. They never seem to be very crowded when I want to go, usually on the early side. I do love the ambiance, which is like a nice little Parisian cafe. The night I went in to meet two other people, I was early, and sat at our table watching the sun slant into this lovely gem of a room. Very nice vibe....

They had 6 rose wines on the blackboard, from France and Spain as well as the US. I ordered a flight of rose for $15, and expected those dinky little two ounce shot glass kind of things. Imagine my surprise when I got fairly reasonable pours of all three. My friends came, and we proceeded to enjoy an amazing meal. We had the watermelon and tomato salad, the kale and brussels salad for apps. For dinner we black pearl salmon, the vegetable entree (that night it had cauliflower and chickpeas, and a slightly middle eastern flavor), and the rigatoni. The latter was mine, and I have to say,  it was gorgeous, with the perfect ratios and flavoring. I took leftovers home and ate them the next day for lunch, and it was just as good. 

Then, I dreamed about it two nights later.  No really----I dreamed about a pasta dish I had in a restaurant. I had to go back. 

When I went back, I tried the Saint M reisling, which was spectacular. I've been looking for a reisling that is very dry but still has the flavor, that floral, fruity thing I associate with the wine. I was with another diner, and she had the rigatoni while I had the risotto. These change fairly often---mine was with snap peas and other green summer vegetables. Risotto is always too rich for me, but here again, I brought it home and it made a great lunch.  LAter I discovered you can order a half serving of risotto or the rigatoni, which evidently has been on the menu for like 20 years. 

Unlike several other reviewers, I've found the service to be attentive and informed, especially about wine.  The servers also have personalities, so it's like talking to real people, not automated servant bots. Prices are, to me, very reasonable for the quality of food. I like that I can get in without making a reservation a week in advance, like some other spots on Tremont. I'll definitely be back at this excellent neighborhood cafe.",4.0

366,TjtE36GaUatWpUqq4nwGXw,"I started coming to Lucas because I was tired of modern medicine. The medical industry just wanted to give me more medications and take more of my money without actually helping or correcting any of my issues. 

My wife and I decided to make a big change in our eating habits, exercise schedule and how we dealt with medical issues (homeopathic). With all the good that came with these changes we still had a few issues... I thought I had carpel tunnel in my right wrist and I couldn't sleep at night; I tried almost everything natural we could find to correct the problems but nothing seemed to be working. 

My Daughter was going to an Acupuncturist in Chicago to help with her migraines and she asked her for a referral in Austin, Texas. Lucas was recommended because they had studied acupuncture together! 

I was a bit skeptical at first because I didn't want to become a  pincushion... so I decided to let my wife try it first. After seeing how quickly it was improving her issues; I decided to give it a try. Lucas is amazing and really understanding! He walked me through the whole process and really helped me grasp his profession and eased any uncertainties I had. 

Every time I gave him a challenge he helped me correct it -  I cannot recommend Lucas enough!",5.0

Next we ordered the plateau which was nothing short of magical and oustanding. The ceviche was on point, perfect level of acidity with sweet peppers and gorgeous fresh fish. Not a fan of the littleneck clams but that's just a personal preference, however, the shrimp cocktail was delicious, a classic and a goodie. The dressed lobster with loads of fresh herbs was heavenly and the char-grilled octopus with green chili's and blistered snow peas I could probably eat for the rest of my life. The octopus was so tender and rich and the peas and peppers added a necessary brightness that elevated the entire dish. The service was fantastic, very friendly, welcoming, quick and knowledgeable about the menu. No complaints about the automatically added 20% tip. If you don't like it, don't go out to eat! We would gladly return!",4.0

369,NPRHJ6YaMHy6e1x6a3eaUA,"Being a Pho Pasteur girl myself, friends of mine who swear by Pho Hoa decided to take me here for a pre-movie dinner. The atmosphere is a bit nicer than the usual joints in this area, a place you don't have to warn people about before taking them here (date night perhaps?). The menu's pretty extensive and everything looked good, and I was intrigued by the 7 courses of fish and beef they had on offer as well as the wide variety of bubble tea and slushies. 

My friends swear by the pho here, but I rarely deviate from Bun with Pork when I have Vietnamese (which is probably my favorite kind of pork EVER), and last night was no exception. One note is that Pho Hoa's Bun didn't have just pork as an option, so I had to go with the pork plus spring roll... I have no problems with the spring roll, it's kind of like getting a bonus app with your entree, but that extra fried bit tends to put me over the edge of fullness so I usually prefer just the pork option (plus the pork is my favorite part so the more of it I can get, the better). My Bun was delightful (it looked especially impressive here for some reason, the components were arranged so artfully), but I could have used a bigger container of nuoc cham, and also prefer my nuoc cham with slightly less red pepper flakes. But overall a solid tasty version with no major complaints from me, and comparable pricing to anywhere ($7.75). My dining companions of course really enjoyed their pho, and it did look good. Also, they served us cold tea, which was really refreshing on a hot summer day and a nice unique touch.

Service was spotty here though, they were good when we first arrived and our food came speedily, but we couldn't find anyone to initially take our order and then to get/take our check, which was annoying. I'd say Pho Hoa is a solid choice when you're looking to be in a bit more upscale environment, but I don't plan on turning my back on Pho Pasteur any time soon.",3.0

I was very excited to try Sweet after it opened and the very cute atmosphere gave me hope that I would be in for a treat.  I got my cupcakes to go and I was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging.  However when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes I was sorely disappointed.  The cake was dry- really, really dry.  Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry.  The frosting, by contrast was sweet- really, really sweet.  Cloyingly sweet- really quite unpleasant.  I ended up throwing 1/2 of each away- it was really that bad.  
I think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake- but honestly... it isn't all about marketing!

Although we're supposedly experiencing a cold front with a balmy high of 92!) I was hoping for a taste of home here. 

I was definitely satisfied with the interior, which was a nice open and clean space with simple tables and chairs. I saw some people enjoying lunch together, a few solo folks working away on a laptop enjoying a quiet lunch. Unfortunately, there's only one wall that has any outlets in the whole cafe. Music doesn't get too loud or distracting, but something about the acoustics in the room somehow amplify people's voices so you can hear the next table if you are into dropping eaves. 

When you walk in, you order at the front, and receive a number to clip onto a holder on your table. I got the Santa Cruz Chicken Sandwich, since the cashier said this and the Santa Clara sandwich were their most popular. Paired it with a bag of Ms Vickie's chips and it came out to about $8.  I definitely enjoyed the sourdough bread, that was definitely like home. Otherwise, I thought the sandwich was tasty, but nothing I can see myself craving for later.

Pros: Entree were delicious, we seasoned and served hot and quickly. Beer was cold and served with a cold glass. Service was prompt and server was polite and fun. Prices were reasonable for the quality of entrees.

Cons: Decor is tired and furniture and carpet is in dire need of being cleaned or replaced. The menus were sticky (plastic covered pages). The place just felt dirty which made the experience uncomfortable. Steamed pot stickers were chewy and tasted like they had been sitting a while. Prices were high based on the general feel and the lackluster pot stickers.

I've been going to this barber shop since i was 17 and now I'm 22 and I'm deciding to part ways with this particular shop. If anybody needs a barbershop recommendation, I prefer  cut n edge on Massachusetts Avenue.

We ordered the bbq pizza with the new bbq drizzle and cheddar crust. Sorry but it was not that great. Wasn't expecting much because it's Pizza Hut but with all the new commercials I expected it to be better than it used to be. Bbq sauce was way too sweet and meat tasted funny.,2.0

The girl that called said that the patio was our only option as the Dining Room is for couples that are getting away for date nights and that you like to keep that area quiet.  

I am puzzled...  Talk about first and last impressions...  She didn't even ask the ages of my kids?

Just cancelled that reservation via Open Table and found another option for tonight.  Maybe Bobs Steak House downtown will let my family dine in the main dining area.

421,oklmmvhL5nfBQRBw8L0ibA,"Yuck. And I'm being generous. We were all geeked on finding this vegan/veggie Chinese restaurant. But were sorely disappointed.  We were the only ones there, asked for recommendations, and opted to order take-out. We focused on the ""meat"" dishes. The food all tasted the same -- and not good at that. Kinda like they used the same sauce for everything with just very minor alterations. We ended up tossing half of it away as it was just that unappetizing. 

Vegetarian/vegan can be made so good, and there is so much potential with Chinese and Asian cuisines... so there is just no excuse for their unimaginative, boring, bland food.",1.0
422,vhC7FdZked0IamRjBPNdiQ,"We ventured in here when the place we were going to eat lunch at was too packed but, I have wanted to try this place for a while!  The parking in this lot is a nightmare so, I would recommend parking at HEB and walking over.  The interior isn't anything to write home about; just your standard quick serve ambiance.

It's like an assembly line of sandwiches or salads, much like subway!  Since it was our first time we didn't really know how it worked but we were on our own to figure it out as the employees didn't ask if we had dined with them before and then offer us an explanation.
I ordered a Kebap with beef and lamb and then added a little lettuce, cucumber, onion and topped it with the garlic sauce.  It was nice that they put sauce on first and top it at the end again.  I think this is the only thing that saved my sandwich from being so dry that I threw it away.  That being said, I was very disappointed with the meat because I was thinking it would be juicy due to the cooking process and that lamb was in the combination.  It was very dry and not very flavorful.  The bread was decent but, coupled with the dry meat, it didn't help. 

The veggies were nice and fresh and that was a plus.  They do have a nice bottled beverage selection.

I also sampled a French fry from my friends place and they were decently seasoned and fried well.

Overall I was disappointed but, after speaking to some other yelpers I found out that they swear by some of the other locations.  Maybe I will venture to another location to try it again.",3.0

They checked in on us 3 times for tea and the food came quick. The food was Asian fusion and reasonably priced for their large quantity. They reminded me of ""The One"" near by with their food, but Myst has higher quality food. Their combos were unnecessary. Their drinks were expensive and their side dishes suck (beans and tofu slices). You had to order side dishes to get drinks( milk teas). I recommend not getting side dishes. They are tasteless.

The group I went with ordered four dishes. Place was kind of packed, but it took us about an hour to get our food, one at a time, which i didn't think was worthwhile considering the quality of food we got.

I don't exactly remember the names, but we ordered a noodle dish, sweet and sour pork, hot-braised chicken, and some beef dish.

The noodle dish was not bad, but the rest was not worth the price and time.

The sweet and sour pork was way overcooked. It was too crispy and even hard. The beef dish was too strong in its flavor and salty. And the  hot-braised chicken had no taste whatsoever. It just tasted like chicken with nothing on it. 

Plus, the service was terrible. Our waitress did not bother to visit our table except to bring us our food, which was about an hour after we ordered, to bring the check. She did not visit once to check up on us. Not once. My friend who wanted a refill on water could not get it and ended up just drinking my water. And we were there for total of 2 and half hours.

Rating the red line against other public transit services I've used in the US and abroad, no, it can't hold a candle to anything in Japan or some of the better Metro lines in Paris. But those lines are well-funded. That's simply not the case anywhere in the US.

Simply because the T shuts down at night, it's cleaner than anything in NYC. Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. 

Look, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars.

437,BU0jaSe_hjBeMNkaGD_-9A,"After my bad experience, the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up, despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review. She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. 

When I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.

Then, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. 

When I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. 

So now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's ""200% Peace of Mind Promise,"" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *""only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp."" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house.

Delivery:
We flew into Boston and got in super late and found that this place was open until 3am! Score! We made the order through Yelp at 1:05am last night, thinking we'll have some awesome food to eat! We called to make sure that they received the order and was, indeed, delivering it. They told us 40 minutes. This was at 1:10am. 

2AM - No food. We call and they tell us that the guy left half an hour ago and should be there any minute. We call the third party ordering system 15 minutes later (2:15am) and ask them where's our order. We're starving. We haven't eaten real food (only plane snacks) since noon west coast time, since we've been on the plane the whole time, we were just hungry. They tell us to keep waiting. Our food finally shows up at 2:38am. They apologized and said it was very busy.

Food:
You'd think that because we were so hungry, we'd just think the food was delicious all around, right? No. It was not. The food was barely warm, and mostly closer to room temperature. We ordered the Taiwan Style Wonton Soup - the soup was flavorless, the noodles were mushy, but the wontons had decent flavor to them. The soup tasted like a watered down version of how the soup should be. We also got the beef fried rice, which was fine for fried rice. We also got the Panfried Pork Buns Shanghai Style, which was cold by the time we got it, so it was pretty gross. I can't speak to how it might taste when it's warm.

The decor at Grub Burger is modern.  Sleek.  We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  

Drew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.

The Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.    I loved the bun.

The Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw.  Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.

446,Ek_wtLgk00RrG2n1xLShkw,"So, myself and five friends decided to try the famous Wahlburgers. We were curious to see what all the rave was about. We were greeted at the door by a cordial young lady and she told us the name of our waitress and that she would be right over. She approached our table within a minute or so and introduced herself. She was very kind and a great waitress. I just wish I remember her name. We went in about 6:30 PM and at that time there were only a few other parties inside eating. 

We ordered our burgers and I must admit that they were all cooked to perfection. They were on the bland side and nothing to brag about. I don't think they were flame broiled on a nice hot live flame...... too bad for us. We ordered tots and they were so-so. The onion rings were very good and sliced nice and thin and yes, they were crunchy. Five had sodas and one had tea. 

As we tried to carry on a conversation, it was difficult to do so. The music was extra loud and we could not hear one another talking. Three times we asked for them to please turn it down. We had planned on having a dessert and coffee afterward but we just wanted to hurry up and get out of there because the atmosphere was not pleasant. This restaurant is definitely not geared for the over forty crowd. The music was not the type any of us would listen to. It made for a tense meal. Three finished their burgers and three did not. As for the tots and fries, most of those were left behind too. We quickly asked the waitress for the bill so we could leave. Trust me, none of our meals looked like the pictures do up above. 

We went around the corner to another establishment and had dessert and coffee there. The ambiance was nice and the dinner music was soothing. Ahhhhh, so relaxing..... finally. We carried on great conversation with a lot of laughs. The place was half filled at this time. 

Honestly, the Wahlburgers are way over their heads. They have opened up too many restaurants all over the country and out of the country. Paul and the family are not on site to see how things are being run by outsiders. Right from the beginning from watching the show, Paul was spot on when he made it known that he not happy with the expansion of Wahlburgers. He was afraid the quality would slide and go down.... it did. 

Within a decade or less, I am sure you will see some of their franchises closing. When the owner is not around to watch the day to day operation, you lack the hands on approach as family is missing and that isn't good. More isn't always better and that rule applies to Wahlburgers. 

If I need a burger, I am better off going to Five Guys in the next town... Peabody, Massachusetts. Better food and half the price.

Is that even possible? 

You order at the counter, take a number and wait as patiently as you can for the deliciousness to be brought to you. The staff is friendly, helpful, and our food came quickly. The atmosphere seemed inviting and warm, even with board games!, so I wish that we had been able to stay. This is a perfect restaurant to stay awhile and chat or to get in and out if you are in a time crunch. 

And as for the food, I don't think you can wrong with whatever you choose. I had the Media Noche sandwich, a Cuban with ham, pork, swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Melt in your mouth scrumptious and overall fantastic flavor. I couldn't get enough. The mustard is pretty strong so be mindful if this isn't your thing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the other dishes, but our party also ordered empanadas which received only positive feedback and the Polla A La Brasa (White), chicken with herbs. The entrees are served with three (small) sides and a (small) salad. We went with yellow rice, yucca fries and toasted plantains which were all excellent choices and I'm glad that we divvied them up so the three of us could all try. Loved the sauces that were served alongside, they were versatile enough to go with just about anything...so tasty! Wish I could have tried the empanadas and chicken, they both looked and smelled fantastic.

I'm bummed that I didn't get a chance to try the flan or Cuban-style espresso...so don't short yourself out...make sure to indulge in one of the delicious-looking desserts. If you go to Orlando and don't stop at Sofrito, all I can say is that you will miss out.",5.0

There was only three people in there including myself. I think the only way you'll get decent service is if you place an order over the phone and pick it up.

-REALLY cute ambience. It's like a Beauty and the Beast library.  Bookcases, dark wood, fireplace, Edison bulbs, comfy arm chairs and couches, a big farm table, little vintage containers by the sugar and milk serving area.  I think that's the biggest thing going for this place, especially considering it's a multi-national chain.
-delicious drinks and desserts, excellent sandwiches that are so good hot and toasty
-nice baristas, good at making sure you're helped/getting orders as you're standing in line, and asking how much whipped cream you'd like for some of the fancy drinks (which is great when I don't want much!)
-patio seating in the warmer months

Cons:
-only 3 hours of free wi-fi
-rarely any open seats
-not enough outlets near some of the seats, which is unfortunate when I really need to plug in my laptop or charge my phone
-a bit pricey
-paper reward card stamps can't be added/transferred to the Caffe Nero passport/Level Up app",4.0

First course salad-Fabulous
second course Fish-OVERCOOKED 
Thirdcourse Waygu beef-OVERCOOKED LEATHER, there were people on both sides of me who attempted to cut and eat and could NOT. I was not the only one who sent my dish back untouched. the foie gras topping  was good, but not enough to help make the beef edible. We didn't even have the option to comment or send it back.
The Table should be imbarrassed and ashamed!!!!!'
Fourth course-cheese plate,minimal but enjoyable.
Fifth-Dessert was a home run. Blueberry buckle and flan over duck egg pavlova (like meringue ) and a side of extra mini treats.
Wine pairings were enjoyable.
atmosphere was fantastic
Customer service-SUCKED!! I watched them clear FOUR Waygu beef plates that were UNTOUCHED because they were SO OVERCOOKED and not edible.
NOT ONE CHEF/ SERVER ASKED OR APOLOGIZED FIR THE DISGUSTING BEEF!!!
When a chef sees numerous plates of UNEATEN food returned to kitchen and doesn't find out why... They clearly DO NOT CARE!!!
They are ""trained chefs"" and plated  over cooked fish and beef and served it to us!!
INSULTING! DISGUSTING!OBNOXIOUS!!

TAKE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!! THE TABLE does NOT deserve patrons with the overcooked food they intentionally served us...

Not to mention when we finally commented on the over cooked beef, they could have cared less.

I am so disappointed because I like to support local restaraunts ,especially who use local products. BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING The Table!!!!

SIDENOTE- I went with friends who were repeat customers and said their first experience was AMAZING! However the experience this time was disappointing to our friends as well! A restaraunt  that isn't consistent at that level of ""cooking/dining"" experience is NOT acceptable. Especially since the owners/chefs could care less that they served their paying guests OVERCOOKED meat and fish!!! No excuse!!!!",1.0

I went with a fairly large group so we'd all ordered something different (back when it was $6 for everything, it looks like they've changed that now). At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.

465,R7xK43_uVcOprrpKXFItQw,"Don't think of Mangia as a pizza place.  Think of it as a neighborhood restaurant that happens to serve pizza. By doing such, you accomplish two things.  First, you won't be disappointed by the pretty good pizza.   Second, you'll see the other things on the menu including burgers, pasta, and sandwiches.  For the record, I highly recommend the pasta with marinara sauce and grilled chicken. (FYI, the garlic breadsticks they serve with the pasta are reason alone to order pasta.)

As an appetizer, I highly recommend the Mangia Fries which are battered before cooking.  I think they're among the better fries in town.

The service at this location also excels.  Our waitress kept drinks refilled, delivered our order promptly, and was friendly without hovering.

475,Tz2IdWYqVqnIpAvOPPVHaw,"This review is in regards to my experience with Oak + Fort's online website, more specifically, their Customer Care department. I can sum it up in one word: nonexistent. I purchased a gift voucher online as a gift for my bridesmaid back on August 31st. I would have purchased it in person at their downtown Vancouver location, but as I had been busy with my wedding and I had flown in from out of town that week, I simply did not have the time. I thought I had saved myself so much time and effort by purchasing a gift certificate online. I couldn't have been more wrong.

They only accepted PayPal for payment, which wasn't a problem. I received the receipt for my payment right away, but it wasn't until September 9th (more than a week later) that I received an email from a Stephanie from Customer Care confirming who she was to send the voucher to. I responded on the same day, requesting that she send the voucher to my email address so that I could then forward it to its recipient. I never heard from anyone again. I sent another email on September 12 (nothing), and on September 17th I told them that if I didn't hear from them by the end of the week, I would file a dispute with PayPal to get my money back. Throughout this time, I attempted to phone Customer Care (no one responded) to deal with this issue. I also made sure that the gift voucher did not get lost in my (and the gift card's recipient's) email spam folder. I finally got so fed up, I went ahead and filed a dispute with PayPal on September 20th. One week later, Oak + Fort had still not responded to the dispute, so I escalated the dispute to a claim to get my money back.

It's a shame I've had such a horrible experience with Oak + Fort because I really am a fan of their clothing and aesthetic, along with their sister company, Loft82. But for a company with a continuously growing online presence (Facebook, Instagram), it's  frankly pathetic how bad their customer service department is. I even tried writing on their Facebook page in the hopes that SOMEONE would see and respond. It's unbelievable that they have no problems updating their Instagram and Facebook accounts daily, but no one can even be bothered to respond to messages in their Customer Care department. Even more, for something as simple as purchasing an online gift card where it is to be received by email (and not even through regular mail), it's inexcusable that it's taken this long without a reply. It's been over a month, and as of today I still have not heard a single word from the company since September 9th. I will provide an update if I ever end up hearing from them to see how they handle the situation.",1.0
476,HlJe2RDnNh7mN9oLFJHa5Q,"Happy Feet is fantastic! I had been looking for a good and inexpensive groomer in my aera and after seeing other reviews i figured i'd take a chance. My 9 year old Maine Coon, Unagi, has extremely thick and long hair, and no amount of brushing him seemed to make a difference. He clearly was hot and uncomfortable with all that fuzz, and i cant deny that having a kitty with a lion cut seemed too awesome to pass up. 

He's a big baby and hates leaving the comfy confines of him home, so he cried the whole way to Happy Feet. Within 1 minute of being in Rachel's arms, he relaxed and began to purr and in less than an hour he was looking fabulous and had been shaved, nails cut, ears cleaned and been looked over from ears to tail. Rachel did a fabulous job and made sure he looked and smelled his best while still being comfortable. Her massive amount of experience shows in the great job she does, and her love for our feline friends shows in her quality of work.

I lucked out and got pretty good roommates - this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex. It's luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor. A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog, he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room. The replacement roommate didn't clean to the point where his room should've been declared a bio-hazard. Like seriously, the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week. 

The main issue is if these people aren't your roommates, it means they're your neighbors. Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves, let alone another living creature, but for some reason have all adopted puppies they're too immature to actually take care of. There's constantly dog feces everywhere, even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment. Sometimes, they just leave the dog outside, completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that they're required to be on a leash. I'm amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars. 

There's constantly garbage everywhere - there's was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for 5 days. There's a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into - at one point they were up to 3 pizza boxes, a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree. The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it, but it's like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest. 

Because the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere, there are constantly roach problems. No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control (which frequently gets ignored) you will still have roaches. Forever. 

They advertise ""gigabyte internet"" in every room, but it cuts out almost every week, so good luck with that. 

A significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students, the office is pretty much run by idiot college students. The few that actually try to do their job and aren't completely incompetent don't seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you.

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. 

After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. 

Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set.

The stark, drab atmosphere feels less tasteful minimalist, more like an abandoned warehouse. There was no TP in the bathroom so I used a seat cover and their trash was overflowing. An employee was the last 1 in there, she probably should not have let me in there with the bathroom so unkempt. I've had a lame Dosha pedicure before, so when I got a gift cert. for a pedi for Xmas I decided to apply it to hair color instead. I'm in town for the holidays and my roots were bugging me. I'm aware of the varying levels of technicians & I requested a mid-level. My hair is bleached and I didn't know whether to book a retouch or a lowlight so I was surprised that the receptionist didn't require me to come in for a consult before booking. She didn't ask the length or type of my hair, its very fine but there's a lot of it and it's long. When I beheld the stylist I was assigned, I was less than confident about her abilities. Her hair wasn't styled and her overall appearance didn't give me that ""Make me fancy like you"" feeling. I determined it might be best to skip a root retouch and just do a toner on the brassy blonde so the grow-out wouldn't be such a glaring contrast. She can't mess that up too much. My ends were darker than the top and needed lightening before we did the overall toner to even out the color. We agreed to bleach the ends then tone. Ok. Then she got repetitive & dragged the consult out, having me sign a waiver which she took forever to fill out. I felt like I was at a beauty school. She soaked my ends in a lightener for a bit then she had a male stylist nearby come look at her work afterward- did I get an apprentice? Then it was off to the sink to wash and tone. Her nails in my hair were kinda grossing me out, it wasn't a delightful soothing shampoo. I felt my hairs snag and snap in her unkempt nails. It looked to me like she didn't leave the bleach on the ends long enough. I asked her how it looked, did she think the ends match and she said ""they'd better after all that work I did"". Okay chic you didn't have to weave or foil. When she walked away I grabbed the ends to compare them to the top and they looked darker. Wet or dry they should match. I was over it, the appt took over 2 hours- by the time I left I was late for my plans. She kept talking about how much hair I have. If the receptionist would ask basic questions about the clients hair when booking you wouldn't have any surprises. If long hair is too much work for you, go back to foiling dummy heads they probably let you sit down for that. She had someone help her blow dry me because of ALL of this HAIR that I have and continued to remark and huff about all my hair. I'm not Cousin It, its past shoulder length hair. I'm accustomed to being blown dry using a round brush, you know given some style but she just blasted it downward using a paddle brush. When she finished, she didn't give me a mirror to see the back and the lighting was so bad I was having a hard time even seeing how the color turned out. I had to stand up to see my hair, and she didn't ask how I liked it I just felt like I was dismissed. She was totally unapologetic about the poor lighting and when I remarked that my hair looked unfinished she said ""Yeah it probably needs a flat-iron"" so I asked if she was going to do that and she said she didn't have time.  ""I underestimated how long your hair was going to take"". I believe she had another client waiting. How rude to imply that it's my fault she ran out of time because of my hair length. I came in with my hair styled, I left with my style looking flat and worse than when I came in on a Friday night. I had plans in the neighborhood why should I need to go home and style my own hair when I just had a salon service? Turns out the toner she did worked pretty well- I was able to check myself out in proper lighting when I got to the bathroom at the BAR. I almost felt bad for only tipping her $10 on $85 but I just reminded myself that she didn't appear to care whether I was satisfied or not. She would've had twice that if she'd given 2 sh!ts",1.0

511,w0hPzEtnNzu4KVK_zie3rA,"I went to Burtons for the first time on Monday for lunch. I didn't have any expectations because I had never heard about it before. 

The hostess was away when we walked in, but returned shortly and seated us pleasantly and promptly. I was pleasantly surprised looking over the menu at the variety of selections. My Mom and I love to try a lot of different plates so we decided to share the beet salad, the risotto fritters (why don't they just call them arancini?) and the grilled stuffed zucchini appetizers instead of entrees. 

Our waitress, Melissa, was really polite and helpful - she refilled my Mom's tea without being asked and brought our dishes in the order we requested. I will definitely ask to sit in her section again. 

OK the food - the beet salad was a revelation. It tasted like they had roasted fresh beets - not canned. We were both scrapping the plate. Both the risotto fritters and the baked zucchini came with tomato sauce that was fresh, chunky and had a great balance of acid and sweet flavors. The food all tasted fresh and carefully prepared. 

So why only 4 stars? 

We ended with cheesecake that was supposed to come with raspberry coulis. We expected a sauce. We got a drizzle. It was definitely lacking compared to the description. 

Also, the ladies room needed a lot of tiding up - there was paper all over the floor. Considering this was a Monday lunch and it wasn't crowded (there were servers cleaning the dining room) the ladies room should have been in top shape.

512,LfpTxjAjSUrslq4pw5nt0A,"After all the hype I've heard about this place, consider me underwhelmed.  I stopped in here for lunch last week after a nearby appointment.  While the menu seems very fun and inviting for the adventurous diner, I guess I just wasn't in the mood to spend $19 on a burger and rings.

In all fairness, the food was good, just not outstanding.  I had the lamburger ($12), which was enjoyable, but there was WAY too much going on under the bun.  Let's see...marinated (read 'pickled') vegetables, arugula and pickled onions, citrus goat cheese, tzaziki sauce and, oh yeah, the burger!  IMO, they should scrap everything pickled and stick with the  basics; burger, cheese, arugula and sauce...maybe a mango chutney or something.  They should learn the lesson that simplicity is highly underrated.  The onion rings ($4 for about 10 rings) were also good, but I've had better for less.  Not sure what beer mustard is, but is tasted an awful lot like light honey mustard.  Not offensive, they just expended lots of effort where they could have backed off and let the food speak for itself.

No one enjoyed their meal.  It was the same menu as virtually every other location in Universal, except for Harry Potter locations (which are all pretty much the same themselves).

Universal should take this cue - run each restaurant on it's own, with a separate creative, management and service team. Hold each restaurant to a higher standard of uniqueness and food quality and variety.  

Every dining spot in Universal feels the same, and this is no different. Same menu choices, same way of cooking, virtually nothing healthy to select, and table space is just too scarce.

519,0COqpnRyHtQ0DAi3XIBGng,"I don't know who these sales tactics work on but I guess they wouldn't be employed if they didn't. We narrowed our choice on a specific car. We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC, since they were closer, and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price. 

We call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot. They say: yes, several of them. We go there. The guy we talk to (Keith?) has the sleaziest demeanor. His entire desk is full of pictures of his family (and by full I mean like 20) and awards saying ""master of excellence"". I'm sure he has a Ph.D. in Awesomeness, too, but he doesn't have physical space to display that.

He tells us we want a good car, which everybody wants , but the trouble is (wait for it!) no dealer in New England has it. He is able to check that. No, really. Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first... unless he wants to give us an offer. He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we'll talk price.

Let's pause for a minute. Suppose you're a Honda dealer and you honestly don't have a relatively popular car. Wouldn't you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be? I mean, you do expect customers inquiring, don't you? Of course, you would. Either he didn't have a car or he knew he didn't want to sell it to us at the price that we wanted. Either way he was lying to us.

So he left the desk, and we checked our emails for a while and then we simply got up and left. I know they think if they waste enough of our time we will feel like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf. Like I said... I guess it's working on some people. Why else would they try it on us? As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn't stop. He called me like 8 times and I didn't answer.

We went to that other place the same day and bought the car. 

In summary: do research online, BID ONLINE. Don't ever go to the dealership without a firm price promised and a VIN of the vehicle that they say they have. Never trust a car dealer to tell the truth. Doesn't mean you should fight them. But if the only way you know something is through them telling you then you simply don't know it. Always, ALWAYS, be prepared to walk out at any stage. Some people say, signing should take hours. FALSE! Tell them you will walk out if they do one wrong move AND MEAN IT. They will do ALL paperwork in less than an hour. Most of us want cars that are in abundance. Understand that and you will immediately understand that you should be the one in charge during the whole process.

The menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. 

For the entrée, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible.

Yes, it is a little different from a traditional massage in the US. The style is clearly less inhibited. Instead of being buried in blankets and exposing bits and pieces of the body to work on, the therapist uses a fairly small towel to cover just enough of the body for modesty purposes.

However, the results were amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the technique and felt fantastic when I walked out. I thought the $60 up front for 60 minutes was a great deal and I tipped $20 to show my appreciation.

I ordered online delivery of a cake, but then tried to immediately  cancel the order once I saw that shipping (within Cambridge, to an address only several blocks away!) was 43 dollars.  I tried to call to cancel, but they were closed, and I filled out the online customer service request immediately to cancel.  They never cancelled my order.  However, they still charged me for the cake and the delivery, which was a day LATE anyway.  I called today to get some of the delivery fees refunded, and the employee told me they ""did get my email message, but it was too late to cancel the order.""  Why did they not contact me?  I don't know.  The employee then told me I would have to call the store directly to get a refund for delivery fees.  She said she would call them for me, and that I would get a call back right away.  Nobody called me back.  What horrible customer service.

UPDATE (5/23):
I forgot to mention that when the cake was going to be delivered, I got a call from an unidentified person saying I was going to receive a packaged surprise that morning.  Since it was Mother's Day I was all excited, thinking I was going to get a gift.  But no, it was Rosie's Bakery calling me, the buyer, rather than the recipent, to notify of an upcoming delivery.  So that really sucked, staying home, waiting for a  Mother's Day present that never came.  Bummer.  But today I actually managed to get someone on the phone who would refund the delivery fees to me, since the cake did get delivered to my recipent, even though it was woefully late.

Always down for Vietnamese food, so I dropped by later in the afternoon to try it out. The interior is clean, modern, outlets and USB ports everywhere. I was warmly greeted at the counter and ordered tumeric fish over rice with an ice coffee.

Food came out in about 10-15 mins, nice presentation, unfortunately the only utensils available were these flimsy plastic knife, fork, and spoons. The rice was cooked with leek and garlic, that's a new one for me, I wasn't able to taste much of a difference compared to white rice. May have been from the overpowering flavor from the tumeric fish. Fish was good, roasted veggies were fantastic albeit a bit oily, and the pickled veggies were excellent. Vietnamese ice coffee was pre mixed, very strong, you might want to let dilute itself in ice. 

Had the lemongrass beef banh mi on another day and it was disappointing. For an $8 sandwich it was pretty small. There wasn't enough pickled carrots and daikon to balance the meat out.

Our 2 slices of pizza came another 15 minutes later like warm and not very flavorful. The couple behind us had to refill their own drinks and go searching for silver wear.

The entrees were okay, but the clincher making this my last stop ever was the fact that they took the bar-b-que pork away.

The place is small and there is no order to the line. So people get antsy, especially since the service is slow. The girl who ""helped"" us was not very nice, didn't let us finish ANY of our orders (she'd make incorrect assumptions and try to finish our sentences, only to have to fix it later). When she repeated our order (after I asked her to) two of our five items were wrong and one was not even there. So we repeated our order. We ordered a bagel with ham, cheese and egg and another with cream cheese and egg. We never got our brownie (because even though we repeated it three times she didn't ring it up) and so we had to ask for it in the front of a line of disgruntled people who'd been waiting for awhile. And when I opened my sandwich on the bus I got a ham, egg and cream cheese bagel and my boyfriend got a bagel with cream cheese. Nothing like what we ordered... AND WE REPEATED IT! Twice!

557,d9jkwxeLu0gy79fbFkg4gg,"For the money we spent here, two stars is being really nice.  We registered at this location and had a pleasant experience with Allison.  When I returned to purchase the remaining registry items and our nursery furniture, the chaos began.  First of all, the crib I'd spent months searching for was back ordered 10-12 weeks.  My problem with this is that there was absolutely no indication of the furniture being back ordered anywhere!!!  Online it said the furniture was available and would ship within 2 weeks. So of course I wonder why it's readily available online, but not when I purchase in store.  My rep (Heather) tells me it is one of the most popular cribs and that an online purchase is different from an in-store purchase because the furniture ships from a different warehouse.  But should I care?! How about order it from whichever warehouse gets it to the paying customer fastest? Or, easier than that, warn your customers some of the cribs might take 3 months to arrive. So...I decide to go with my second crib choice and it was the exact same thing!! Really?! Finally I try to go with my 3rd choice and of course they had trouble finding the item number even though the furniture was on display in the store.  Ugh!!  When they found the item, they couldn't find the advertised color I wanted.  I was thoroughly aggravated by this point. I was prepared to leave and go to a different location or simply order off line, but then I wouldn't have been able to use the coupons I had (which I didn't understand either). Beyond all that, I go to purchase other things off the registry and they aren't available either! I had to change several things about my nursery because this location didn't have the items they allowed me to scan/add to the registry.  Heather was okay, and seemed to try everything she could, but she also seemed confused and like she was saying whatever she needed to say to keep me there.

560,WWsKpPdPcvhs630g7XrhsQ,"Being from California, my husband and I are always on the hunt for some authentic Mexican food, which we have a very hard time finding living in the panhandle. While on vacation in Orlando I took to yelp to find us a good dinner after being sick of eating theme park food for three days! When I saw border grill I was sold. Hole in the wall local places are my favorite! Especially considering I work in one so that might make me a little biased:) 
When we got there it was packed and it made me so ready to eat some good food! All the reviews I read said you order at the counter so we walked up and stood there for a while while the girls were busy behind the counter filling drinks and using the register. We patiently waited but no one looked up.. Maybe they were too involved in their work, I don't know. Eventually a girl walked by and said have a seat anywhere you'd like. Okay, so we sit outside at one of the only available tables in the place. I made eye contact with our waitress (the one who told us to sit anywhere so she knew we were wanting to eat there) at least 3 times and still she never came out for AT LEAST 5 minutes. Being a waitress this is unacceptable leaving a table sitting not greeted that long. We listened to the table behind us complaining about the time they had been waiting for their food. Finally they wave her outside and she talks to them, apologizes for the wait and gets their food out promptly. We then think... Okay this is it she's going to acknowledge us. Nope she just walked by again. Finally when she brings them some drink refills she walks by and says are you wanting to order? Um well we need menus we've never been here and she says ""oh you want to dine here?"" 
Who knows maybe sitting outside means you want it togo but I was assuming we could sit anywhere like she said and that was the only place that had open tables. 
After we got menus and drinks everything went smooth from there- 
We used yelps check in deal to get free chips, salsa and queso! Added bonus- we got a little guacamole too! My husband is a huge queso fan so he devoured that. I was partial to the guacamole so we were both happy with that. we both ordered the Chicago burrito recommended from fellow yelpers and they did not disappoint! I ordered mine with shredded chicken and my husband ordered the al pastor(pork) we were in HEAVEN!!! They also have a caddy of different hot sauces that we poured all over our burritos! Super good. The hottest one is the bright green and it wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it it was very good! Try it you won't be sorry! After the other tables left our server was way more attentive so maybe she was just overwhelmed and the food was so good we left very happy.

On the positive side, the wait staff were outstanding and very helpful.  The inside of the place looks nice and has a nice feel.   

Unfortunately, the negative side is the food.  The ribs were horrible.  Very dry and leathery with only a little sauce.  No sauce bottles on the table anymore.  You know when you overcook pork and it gets that dry stringy texture... yeah, that was our ribs.   My wife ordered brussel sprouts and she literally couldn't eat them...and she loves Brussel Sprouts.... six bucks for inedible brussel sprouts.  Our fries were cold, too.   Ugh.   For appetizers we tried the scallops and box of onions.  The box of onions were good and I'd order them again.  The scallops were not my thing as they had a very strong flavored melted cheese on them that overwhelmed those beautiful scallops.

The Beantown Diner lost a lot of respect in our book the last time we went.  We stepped in and waited for a seat (the entire restaurant was full, there were no open tables).  At least three waitresses told us ""take a seat wherever you'd like.""  There were no seats.  When the third waitress told us to take a seat yet again, my fiance simply said ""I don't see any that are open"" to which we both got a ""ugh, whatever"" pissed off look before waitress number three stormed off.

My husband had ordered the chicken sandwich and I ordered the hot chicken plate. He also ordered the fries with no pickle. After we had sat down they brought my husband the fries and said he could have them on the house because they accidentally put pickle but they would be bringing out a new order without the pickle. In my opinion that was a very good move however the new backs they brought out had a hair in it and we ended up not eating it nor did we bother to bring it to the front. Why? Because by this time we had also received our main meals and those were so unsatisfactory is that we had some get up as not a good food place so no point to ask for new ones. My chicken plate was nothing but mush. The chicken was so thin or had been pounded so much that it had tears in the middle so really it was only a mangled piece of chicken covered in so much breading and sauce that it tasted like mushy meat when eating it. My husband's chicken sandwich suffered the same but also lacked an incredible amount of flavor. It was so Bland!

I expected so much more from this place because of the reviews, however when we were there we could tell a lot of people had ordered the tofu sandwich. The few people that we saw eating the chicken sandwich had actually deconstructed it and ate it with fork and knife. I was incredibly unhappy with the quality of my meal I couldn't even finish it!

I came in and requested an oil change and to have my starter tested, as I was 99% sure that was the issue. After being told that it more than likely wasn't, and my battery was likely the problem (not likely, it's a year old). They go back to do the oil change and test. An hour and a half later, they forgot to run the test on the starter, but surprise! The battery is fine. I'm given a list of other things wrong with my car but told the starter is just ""chaotic"". After authorizing the repair on the cracked radiator hose, I wait for another hour for that to be repaired only for them to come out and tell me that my car won't start yet again and the starter needs to be replaced. 

This entire ordeal felt like a bait and switch. I'm not mad about having to have repairs done on the car, seeing as my car is 9 years old and hasn't needed much work other than to replace the ignition and the locking mechanism in the drivers door. Repairs are expected and I knew this would happen at some point. I'm mad because I told the employees that it was my starter, I was told I was wrong, the test was conveniently forgotten, and what should have taken maybe two hours at the most (which is what my normal mechanic at home said) it took more than 3.

My boyfriend and I had wanted to try here for a while and finally we had the chance to come here on a Saturday night around 7pm. The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.

Our waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. 

She later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.

Dinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check.

This quinoa bowl would scare anyone away from being vegetarian if it was the first vegetarian dish that they ever had.

We also both received a side of tater tots.  They were falling apart which made them hard to dip in ketchup.  Should have cooked just a little longer to put a crisp on them and help keep them together.  Would not mind going back again but will ask for tots to cook longer.,4.0

There are some pretty signature items on the menu that is hard to find elsewhere. For example, their Pulled Pork Corn Muffin was definitely a chef's experiment, the muffin itself tasted more like cornbread than muffin, the random set of toppings they put on top is a novelty but not best package in my opinion, the flavors did not complement each other but rather chaotic. I did really like their Seoul burger with kimichi and sunny side up egg, it was juicy, tender and creamy (from the yolk). The Out of Control Poutine was a little disappointing, it was topped with chili, cheese, and gravy but just ended up tasting like a huge pile of extra salty fries.",3.0

He gives me a recipe slip and tells me to go inside to pay for it. My total for the Ultimate Exterior was $150 give or take since they were having a promo on detailing. 

I left and came back 4 hours later when I received a call. The car looked nice and shiny since it was in the sunlight but there were still some spots on the car.

I was literally standing there picking black things off my car with my nails when a lady came up to give me my keys back. She noticed I was picking at my car and started to help me pick off the black spots. (Obviously she knew that it was unacceptable that spots were left on the car after a $150 detailing job)

I left somewhat unhappy about the job they did on my car and now, a couple weeks later, I notice white marks left on my black trim. They weren't there before I took it in and my scratches have come back.

597,zyfQ6ivIptUw8wrKIVZXNw,"Pho Hoa has trouble slicing its meats so that their thicknesses match the type of cut. For example, rare flank steak should generally be pretty thin, so that it has a good chance of cooking while sitting in the soup. (But probably not shabu-thin). In the bowls I've had at Pho Hoa though, 4 of 4 times my bowls of pho were not only served lukewarm, but the rare flank was not able to cook thoroughly. That was because it was cut way too thickly and because of the soup temperature. Tonight I also nearly chocked and gagged on the bubble tea I ordered: The bubbles were rock hard and not really cooked, and the ratio of heavy cream to tea was so high that the taste of black tea was nowhere to be found. With Pho Thien Thien and Xinh Xinh just around the corner, I see no reason to go to Pho Hoa for the beef pho. (PH's pork chops are another matter; they are really good!). Two stars.

I have been calling this gym since December 2nd, my contract end date, so that I could cancel. No one will return any of my calls, nor tell me if it is okay to send in the certified letter or if I have to do it in person. 

After being on vacation I finally was able to go in in person and just get it over with. Every time I walk in the building, no employees look up to greet anyone, they continue staring at their PCs. I stood there for 30 seconds before saying excuse me can someone assist me? 

I explain I have been calling and talking to people at the front desk and ""leaving messages"" with a ""Clint"" that I need to know how to cancel. I explain no one will call me back and so now I am here in person to get it done. They say, you can only do that Monday through Friday. Are you kidding me? Where are those hours posted? After all of the calls I have made to this gym asking how to cancel and no one tells me I can't come in on a Saturday early afternoon?! 

Finally they let me see someone named Daniel. The front desk employee says ""you can go back to that office"" and points. I go back to the office and Daniel continues to sit on his PC, doesn't look up, and doesn't say hello. He goes on to say that I have to come in Monday through Friday and fill out a form. Could he at least look up and look me in the eye?! Could he say hello how are you? So I sit down and he doesn't like that. I am a customer here, wanting to CANCEL. I explain, I have called SO MANY times trying to ask how to cancel and no one told me I have to come Monday - Friday? He doesn't care. Finally I explain, I worked for a different gym company for 3 years and I would never treat someone with such disrespect as this gym has done for me and that I can't WAIT to cancel. I explain that this is the worst customer service I have experienced at a gym and all I want to do is cancel. I have followed all of the rules, I fulfilled the contract, just give me the paperwork to sign so I can be done. Finally he gets out the cancellation form that was at the top of his drawer. Seriously? All that fuss for something that was readily available to you? 

He then has the audacity to tell me that I should keep my health a priority after I have already explained that I run outside and running is free and that I don't like this gym. I realize he's a gym salesman and they have to say those things when people are cancelling but seriously he couldn't get up off of his behind to greet a customer at the door and he wants to tell me to not be lazy?

623,yUSC4z-dmJlG4Hy-qJD1cA,"I'm going to be the odd man out here. I was tempted to try it out because I've heard several people say they liked Ethiopian, and I had no concept of what Ethiopian food was, so I decided to find out. 

This was my first time, and was a little surprised at the method of serving and eating Ethiopian food.  I've heard injera bread described as spongy and sour, but I expected like, pancake spongy, not... wet sponge sitting in my sink spongy.  I suppose I would liken the bread to a very bland crepe. 

I went with two friends, and we each ordered different main dishes, and asked the waiter for a sampling of various vegetable sides.  Some were really good (whatever the yellow paste was in particular), some were blah, and nearly all of them reminded me of Indian food in texture and taste, but not quite as flavorful.   The best meat dish (forgive me for forgetting the proper name) was a beef cooked in onions and peppers and garlic, kind of like Ethiopian fajitas.  The lamb was.. well, lamb, and the chicken was disappointing - just two drumsticks, no breast or thigh meat at all. 

Unlike most other flat breads, the injera kind of made me sick the more I ate it.   Perhaps because we were noobs to Ethiopian food, we had to order an extra round of injera to scoop up the food, but were too stuffed to eat the injera bread used as the 'plate' and after sitting underneath the food for the whole meal, it got a soggy consistency that wasn't very appetizing.   I will admit they gave us enough food, but I thought it was a little pricey for what it was.  It came out to about $18 a person after tax & tip with no alcohol.    Also it seemed like I had to wait for about a half hour to get my water refilled. 

My biggest gripe isn't anything against this establishment, but against the family-style serving of Ethiopian food.  Now I went with my two best friends, and despite everyone washing their hands before eating, I didn't like the idea of eating food other people have stuck their fingers (which had been licked clean) into.  If you get mad when you see someone double-dip a chip, Ethiopian is not for you.

IMHO you're better off going to an Indian place, getting very similar (but tastier) food, and scooping it up off of your very own plate with some delicious-ass Naan bread.",2.0

625,VSSMHhazrOTgtxPW2Uz88Q,"We wandered into this tiny bar, nestled in an alley off of Park Ave to the right of Boca, last Saturday evening because of a Groupon and were pleased overall but felt a few things could be tweaked to make it truly great.

The menu is extremely limited but I'm guessing that is part of the bar's thing, so while I do respect that, I wish there were more options considering how good the food we did try was. Clams, fish fry, hush puppies; anything, really. I also think it's a great idea to have a burger on the menu since there's always someone in the group who doesn't like seafood. It doesn't really ""fit"" with the theme but it's a smart addition.

We started off with the fish dip appetizer, which came with a few jalapenos and a bag of crackers - seriously, they just handed us a bagged stack out of the Nabisco box. I'm not knocking it, but it was sort of an odd choice of presentation. The fish dip is heavenly, especially with the pickled jalapenos it was served with. 

My wife ordered a dozen oysters, which she thoroughly enjoyed. There was nothing really fancy or unique about them, but they were good, as were the cocktail and horseradish sauces. I ordered a full pound of shrimp which were seasoned with old bay. While they were good, they were - hands down - the messiest shrimp I have ever eaten. The meat pretty much crumbled out of the shell, I could barely keep the shrimp together on my fork. 

For a place that has the word ""Beer"" in its name, I was a little underwhelmed with the selection. They had the traditional macro labels and a few crafts on draft, but it was mostly lighter brews, which I was bummed about. I didn't expect to wander in and find something obscure, but the selection was still disappointing.

Also, not that I am holding this against the overall experience, but, man, this place was dead for a Saturday night. I don't think anyone knows it exists, which is a shame. With a few extra items added to the menu and an expanded beer selection, this could be a cool hangout.

I would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, ""too late."" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their ""personalized sandwiches"" and you get the complete opposite.

And they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper. Ayyyya.",1.0
629,1FXe244ZvdRUT-BwMnk2Pg,"So, I was on the prowl for a
GREAT soup(Not one of those mediocre soups that are all broth and not much of anything else) but a hearty homemade type. Well, 
I was on commercial Dr. And a friend I ran into mentioned this place in particular and what outstanding bowls of soup they had. So of course, I had to check it out! 
 So they had two soups to choose from, the vegetable beef or a minestrone. I got the beef and my girlfriend had the minestrone. 
This place really did not disappoint! Our soups were deep bowls of delicious tasting soup that were hearty, filling and served with a bread! Even even better was the price! $5.50! I would have easily paid $8 anywhere else for the quality and probably would have gotten ""average soup"".

632,o2NiAJ_Sa8jZo26RrHDX6g,"This place is truly exceptional! 

My big goofy pit bull managed to tear up her paws while out for a run and needed all four of them bandaged, and the staff here was just great with her. I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. 

My girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. 

Everyone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. 

I was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  

The vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. 

Finally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. 

I felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.",5.0

Five courses, and each one had incredible flavors, textures, and presentation. 

Conceptually, 3 Five VII allows you to observe the chefs construct your meal, a bit like a performance. They prep, cook, and plate in front of you, and speak directly to you with each course.

635,HALsk1uxBmlnrexRaDpSaA,"Eek, where to start! Perhaps my experience was just a fluke, I'd like to think so given the great ratings this establishment has. I will preface this by saying that I don't mind spending a sizable amount of money on an above average meal, and I always lean toward quality over quantity.  Pricing wasn't necessarily the issue here. What I had an issue with was the price of the meal, combined with the fact that two out of the six dishes ordered were inedible. The remaining dishes were average at best. The salads were ordered came on a plate the size of a large saucer. The lettuce was chopped so finely.. I can't even describe it, it was rather odd. The chicken on top was overcooked and dry. We barely touched them. The corn we ordered was so overcooked, it basically felt like we were chewing on plastic. The fish was decent, but I was slightly shocked at the size given the pricing. Again, I believe in quality over quantity, but here I felt like I received low quality food for a very high price. The best part about our experience was the amazing waitress. She did everything should could to make us happy, but hey, she wasn't cooking so she could only do so much.

I liked the noodles so much I still finished my meal with a grimace.  I think the next table had a better idea and left a few noodles behind. My stomach was still working on the food 9 hours later and I wasn't hungry for that time, which was strange because I'm the kind of person who eats every few hours.

648,TM0UkSnJMMNOlethACN9Pg,"Lucky Plus is a Hong Kong-style cafe restaurant.  I think they recently opened as there were still many bouquet signs in front when I visited with my family.  

The menu seems to have a wide variety of foods from the simple rice and noodle dishes to the more elaborate like braise lamb hot pot.  The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor, with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded.  

But that's where the good side ends.  Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down (at 11am just when they opened).  She came to our table 3 times in a short span of 5 minutes.  We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes (Hand shredded chicken and 7-flavor deep fried squid) and a couple of entree dishes (Fried noodles with chicken, Mapo tofu rice, Sauteed shrimp).  It took almost 35 minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch.  

When the food dishes showed up at last, we were very disappointed at every dish.  The hand shredded chicken was more of cut-up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in.  The 7-flavour deep-fried squid tasted bland -- I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour.  The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special (including taste!).  The sauteed shrimps were not well de-veined so tasted bitter.  We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice?  Well, the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up, but the rice was too hard (tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight).  Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus!  

To add to the poor service and bad quality food, we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten 3 times over!  If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer!  But we were honestly not interested in more of the same bad dishes.  

We hope that Lucky Plus is just testing their kitchen process to make improvements and honing their waiting service to provide a more enjoyable experience for their customers.

My husband and I were first drawn to the proudly displayed rainbow flag out front! :)

We finally stopped in for some drinks and appetizers this past Sunday while my sister and a friend were in town.
Eric, our waiter was super nice, friendly and funny!

The sangria was DELICIOUS.

We just got some fried pickles, fries and chicken wings (it was an eat and drink all day and don't feel bad about it kinda day!) all were great.
Service was a little bit slow, especially since it wasn't really busy- but wouldn't hamper us from going back.

I also did notice staff trying to get passerby's to come in- however, from working in the restaurant business and noticing there not being too many people- it's most certainly the owner/manager telling the staff they have to do that, clearly there want more business so that's one way they are trying to go about it!

While munching I was saying that it's just a little too not in the middle of downtown and seems to get forgotten which is a bummer. Because we had a very nice time!",4.0
677,2vQecqgJSxbLxE1NXb7qsQ,"I would like to expose what happened to me yesterday at Bcs Medford unit

I am Brazilian, I'm here in the US to study. I  would like to expose what happened to me yesterday Monday the 11th of May,at Bcs Medford unit

I  train every day in the unit, usually 2 times a day.
I've always been very well received by all employees.

Yesterday I was doing spinning on a bicycle in the area of ​​aerobic exercise, and my phone rang. I AM aware of the rules and try to respect them all, but because it was something very important I had answer I knew it would be something very fast and urgent.
As soon as I started the call, I was approached by a man accompanied by two other, without identifying himself, he asked me to hang up immediately, I couldn't understand everything he was saying because of my  English not being to good,I'm here just seven months, and I have difficulty understanding , but I asked him to please give me that a minute.
He aggressively surprisingly, supported his arms on the device I was using in totally intimidating position! He continued to speak while I was on the phone, even though I  asked him to stop and repeated that needed a minute and did not speak English !!!
Not happy he started talking loudly to me, partly shouting, accompanied by two other men who crossed their arms to me, exposing me to a situation of big  shame and humiliation,  I hang up the phone and was not able to finish my important call. When I hang up I told him that it would like speak with the gym  manager , to tell him  what happened, then he said it was the ""DIRECTOR,"" and I, with language difficulties, even tried to say it did not agree with the form of his approach and I felt so bad about what happened he wanted me  to stop training. He said for me to follow him down to the reception because he was going to CANCEL MY PLAN IMMEDIATELY.
I was in shock!
I went down, not quite understanding what was happening, and upon arriving at the reception, he took my card in front of  about 10 people,noted the number of my application and asked me to leave the unit immediately !!!!

I never felt so humiliated in all my life, I always try to have a respectful attitude toward everyone, and I was so in a helpless situation, for failing to respond in English everything he said. Luckily my friend arrived in the unit at the time, she speaks English, and I asked her to help  me understand what was going on!
When she started talking he wouldn't allow her to talk and she had to ask him to please be quiet so she can tell him my side of the story, but he wouldn't until she asked him to right in a note the reason for me to be canceling my plan 
That's when he decided to SPEAK like a human should!
And told her it was not necessary for me to cancel my plan...

I am very upset about this, I feel very bad to continue attending the unit, one of the things I like to do are my workouts. And I never thought I could feel so bad about a place that has always welcomed me very well

I asked the employee ID, his name is director Daniel Smith. 

Come on think about what attitudes should I take, and I ask that the BSC to comment on posture and what happened.
I believe that the company's policy is not to humiliate customers (especially those who can not defend them selfs when it comes to not speaking or understanding full English).",1.0

I will return if I can choose Dr. Watson for all future appointments. That's the difficulty with Banfield... not all their services and vets are equal.

We also learned at our last visit. That while Banfield claims it is a Pet Hospital with emergency care, it refused to see or treat a dog that a woman brought in as it had just been hit by car. We suggested going down the street to another vet with a more personal approach and she did.

We ordered the beef negimaki and these little fried avocado tuna boats as appetizers. So delicious! I really enjoyed both.

The music express should be part of this list but mostly now the ride is short, doesn't stop then go backwards like it used to. It was a ride worth waiting for. 

The pirate ship, the scrambler, the swings are all older mainstays but good nonetheless. And if your going to have these older rides Playland, then the Octopus should be there too. The rest of the park is mostly un-amusing.

Playland, you have an awesome space in an awesome location. Get rid of half those crappy rides (starting with the other coaster) and bring in some non-spinning fun stuff that make you think before you go on.

I will pay more for better rides.  Im a big supporter of this place.  Keep changing.",3.0

We were seated upstairs on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was pretty much empty.  We ordered  the Japanese curry and kimchi curry base, with a vegetable plate and a lamb/chicken plate.

730,xNhQ0l5se6GH6CIXbqi1tw,"For me the food gives this place its stars and unfortunately the beer is what loses it.

I won't claim that this place serves the highest quality of product...but it IS a pub.  The food tastes good and the menu always makes me smile.  ""Fungus and mold"" is the name of one of their burgers.  How true is that?  Mushrooms and cheese is nothing but fungus and mold.  Their turkey burger is one of the only ones that I will eat because it is cooked and spiced well.  The beer battered fries are yummy,  The side salads are GIGANTIC so I don't think I even want to know what the dinner salads look like.  I've had a couple misses on menu items, but I certainly don't have to like everything.  The main reason I come here is for the apple crisp!  It is my all time favorite apple crisp that I've had.  Most of the time I will only eat half of my meal so I have enough room for the dessert.

Shuffle board give this place some points.  Face it, it's just cool.

Prices are a bit steep for what it is.  The other reviews are right when they say that you have to pay for add-ons and substitutions...which is what makes the food good.

Now as far as the beer goes; I expect any place with ""brewery"" in the name to have beers that draw me to the place.  Old Market falls short in this category.  The beers aren't terrible.  But c'mon!  We are in Portland!  Why would I settle when there are amazing brews around every corner?",3.0

I had to switch to a glass of Pinot Grigio to go with my pan seared scallops over Lobster Ravioli with a lobster cream sauce. Very tasty indeed! And the hubby had a veil cutlet special over risotto and three shrimps. I didn't get to taste the shrimp, cause he's greedy, but the veil and risotto were delicious.

The office took me a bit to find (inaccurate navigation system), but once I noticed that the clinic was in the Westover Shopping Center, it was easy peasy.

The staff was kind and helpful, as well as willing to answer my quick questions about the bloodwork. I showed up as a walk-in and was in and out within 20 minutes. The phlebotomist who took my blood samples was professional, quick, accurate, and curteous. 

In order to keep my wait time down (being a walk-in), I got there as close to opening as possible. From there, the 15-minute wait was no issue whatsoever.

742,GcHiAopIR_dO4aKM8VQXBA,"So happy to update my last review for Steel... I was contacted by Chuck, the owner of Steel, after seeing my comments following a visit with a college pal. (You might peruse that previous review first for context.)

We had a lengthy phone conversation, specifically about White Tuna - which is an endangered species and, as you'll read in my previous review, was an offending dish during our visit. Chuck invited me back for an on-the-house meal, and I got to spend time with an incredibly dedicated restaurant owner who is committed to this city and excellence in foodieism. (On the day I visited, he had accepted the award from Creative Loafing for the city's best sushi.)

The Lobster Roll, which is one I had during my return visit, is a must. We had a smattering of other tasty nibbles, including the spicy tuna (great) - but the lobster roll was most certainly the stand-out.

Chuck also connected me with a source in New Orleans to interview for a blog post. So, not only was I re-enchanted with a local restaurant I had previously loved - I made a new friend in the process. Support this joint, because Steel opened and survived during the 2008 downturn and is still one of the nicest eating environments in midtown.",4.0

744,BajVn13h8fNu80_4cJhpQw,"Not my first time here but it's definitely been awhile. I remember I used to come here based on the premise that it was the ""best Pho in Austin."" I'm not sure if I really agree with that, mainly because I don't remember.
The drive here is always fun, as the restaurant is located right after a big dip in the hilly road. As I walk in, I always notice the empty buffet to the left. I don't know what time of the day they do buffet, because I have never seen it open (granted, I've only been here like 3 times). 
I guess I never noticed before because I've never had it, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the menu was the PAPAYA SALAD! Having had it at every meal in Thailand, it was imperative that I order it because I have yet to find it at any restaurant in the US. The menu offers it with shrimp but the waitress recommended I try the squid. 
The flavor is not as strong and pungent as it was in Thailand, but this is to be expected. It still had the light refreshing taste of the papaya that I love, though. The grilled and skewered squid was a nice addition, making the perfect appetizing starter. 
I actually didn't opt for Pho at this visit and decided to try the vermicelli bowl instead. It had a good sauce, but for once I feel like they didn't put enough. Most of the time whenever I eat out at Asian places, it's like sodium overload. For this, there was a lot of vermicelli and not an adequate amount of sauce, making the overall taste pretty bland. However, once some of the vermicelli has been eaten and the sauce/noodle ratio was more appropriate, this dish was actually very delicious. The portion was huge also, I had to take some to go. 
If I do not find another place to fill my papaya salad crave, then I MUST come back to 888 sometime in the future.",4.0

The highlight was the first thing we had, the Caribbean milkshake.  It was epic deliciousness.  After that, straight downhill.  I ordered a Papa Rellena for an appetizer. It was pretty bland.  We were excited about our entrees, ordered the daily special, ropa vieia, and a papi's specialty, masitas de puerco.  The ropa vieia was decent, nothing special.  Moist but oversalted.  But it was amazing compared to the masitas de puerco.  It was tough, dry, and bland.  Barely edible.  

The service was slow and uninterested, actually sitting down at a table near us to text for 10 minutes, but he does get credit for noticing we barely touched the masitas, and he comped it.

This small place on Burford Highway can be very easily missed; i mean I missed it trying to get there and had to drive back again to spot it lol, anyway came here with my friend Ravi on Monday night for dinner, we can be very indecisive about our food but the server was super patient with us and luckily spoke Spanish and English like me also, made it much easier for me to explain the food to Ravi. 

We chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing,  also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my  personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain,  and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious. 

All in all we were very satisfied with our dinner that night and would love to come back to try their breakfast in the morning and any other plates they have. So I highly recommend it, please give it a shot, and tell more people about them cause small places like these deserve more attention than the bigger ones everyone already knows.",5.0

Extended Stay Deluxe!  Woohoo!  The place is nothing special but as far as hotels go, most amenity needs were met while my girlfriend and I were in the area for a wedding in nearby Lexington.

There was a small outdoor pool that I didn't use but were being used by other people, to which I asked myself, why are you in a pool in a hotel in Woburn?  There was also a fitness room that I didn't use but I was happy and impressed that such facilities were available.  For the next time I need my pool, fitness, and hotel desires met simultaneously in the Woburn area, I know exactly the place to go!  As for the room itself, we stayed in the studio that had just enough space for a queen, kitchenette, couch, desk and executive chair, cable tv, and a bathroom.  The A/C is also tremendous.

Some perks include free packets of ground coffee to accompany the instant coffee maker, polite white people who checked us in and out, vicarious pool and fitness experiences, and most importantly an arctic blaster.  Some non-perks include imaginary toothpaste and invisible shampoo.  

My girlfriend (aka Sugar Umma) paid $75 for the room for one night (relax butty, I let her have half my burrito) when all was said and slept.  Meanwhile a couple of our friends paid $80 and funnily enough, the Extended Stay website lists rooms starting at $85.

752,l_cweYA417VRalqWZn7qNg,"I'll start out saying I do my research before going to restaurants I haven't tried before and I love the raw, honesty of reviewers. I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).

The atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!

I loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. 

The owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.

I cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. 

We finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray! Our server was lovely and provided great suggestions. You really must try this restaurant and if you like intimacy, don't go on a weekend. It was awesome.",5.0

755,XzyKgekGYVicNP388zBglA,"They were just OK but I would not use them again or recommend them personally. We used them twice for one move. First to put some of our stuff in storage while staging our home and then for the final move a couple months later. The move went relatively smoothly but there were definitely some issues. First, they sent someone out ahead of the move so they could give us an estimate and make sure they had enough truck space. Even with that, they underestimated and there was stuff we had to put in our own vehicles and friends vehicles to transport ourselves AND we had to come all the way back to pick up even more stuff that didn't fit on the trucks. Second, we called ahead of time to discuss moving our Yamaha upright piano. They assured me they could do it, they do it ALL the time. There would be an additional charge of $200. $100 for each set of stairs. It took 4 of them over 30 mins to get it down the first set of stairs, it was so hard to watch I left the room. Then when we got to the new home, they got trapped on the first set of stairs, losing control of it and it ended up falling into the wall and putting a big dent and hole in it. We were calm and cool about it, even though this was a brand new home, and asked if THEY were all okay. Telling them, their safety and well being was our first concern, it's just a wall, etc. They were all white as ghosts and did not look confident at all about getting it up the stairs the rest of the way. We then we told them to just bring it down and move on to emptying the rest of the truck, they look relieved. We haven't even had the piano checked yet, so who knows what that adventure did to the piano. Third, when trying to navigate the treadmill to the second floor, they again got trapped at the first landing. The treadmill had to be lifted over a railing and turned but they had their shortest guy at the front and he just couldn't lift it high enough. On the last attempt, they lost control again and my husband had to help. He ended up having his end of the treadmill fall on his shoulder b/c he was trying to stop it from hitting the head of the smaller crew member. Once the move was finally over, the damage that was done to the house during the move was written on the receipt by the crew boss and this is where our experience turned from okay to crap. When we called first thing Monday morning, we were told that we had to send a certified letter explaining the damages. We asked why would we have to send something in writing explaining it when you're looking at what your crew boss wrote on the receipt. They told us they would have their drywall guy call us, he's the best and he does this kind of repair all the time. That never happened. We called back and have emailed several times but to no avail. A lot of, ""well, let me reach out to him and have him touch base with you."" They're great at lip service. We ultimately sent that certified letter, got a return receipt and still, it's been 8 weeks since the move and we haven't heard from anyone. So, while they can move heavy items, SOME heavy items, from point A to point B, God forbid there is a problem. They do not make solving the problem as much of a priority as getting the business.",2.0

Except for one injection where I felt some pressure, I didn't feel any of the other injections. At one point, I was going to ask him, ""Did you start yet?"" I received Juvederm Volbella because I only wanted filler in my upper lip because it was very small and thin in ratio to my bottom lip. Also, I wanted a more natural looking lip, rather than one that has obviously been filled. When Dr. Slater completed the process, I was shocked because there was no bleeding, during or after the injection and I never bruised either.

I usually take negative yelp reviews with a grain of salt- but the 20 reviewers that complained about the service before me were not being dramatic. you basically have to stand up and wave your arms frantically to get their attention. 

Now to the pizza....we did a half/half situation. half fig&prosciutto, half special (basically a Hawaiian named something fancier). the fig and prosciutto must have required less oven time or something because it tasted like burnt parchment paper.  At first I thought they forgot the Gorgonzola cheese but no- it was just too burnt to taste.  So I guess my first pointer is coordinate pizza choices by cook time? or just bully your dining partner into one kind. 

Now for the tight seating....I get-small restaurant- but if you didn't know any better you would've thought we were a four some with the couple next to us. we were sitting that close.

Pine nuts on rice, steamed and fresh tomatoes side by side, and very tender lamb make for an excellent dish. 

I'm also a fan of their fresh squeezed juices. Just had the carrot juice today and it was very fresh. Don't recommend the mint smoothie -- it was largely pieces of mint leaf on ice. Another must-have is the rice pudding. It's covered in shaved coconut, coconut milk and spices that make it taste remarkably different from usual bland rice pudding.

Not a fan of the service. The key is to go to the bar and chase down a server rather than wait for them to come to you.

There is a parking garage located right beside it and there is an elevator that brings you right to the restaurant.

Gypsy Kitchen is a Mediterranean and Spanish influenced restaurant that features many drinks and a wide range of tapas. Great place to grab some drinks and tapas! They have a rooftop as well.

797,tytfY-T1IQsx6ptSY2qX_w,"Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12/09/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. 

The restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. 

When you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. 

The menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. 

From charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). 

I also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) 

The burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. 

The hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. 

Overall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.",4.0

811,T_sPouhq6oNwUJLrYxsZBw,"We used the Party Place on SE Stark for our wedding last month. If I had the option, I'd probably give them 2.5 starts rather than 2, but I couldn't justify a 3 and you can't do half stars, so....

Our first impression was great. We loved their selection, and their prices seemed comparable to other party rental places (which are all way overpriced, in my opinion, but that's another story). The woman we worked with in the showroom was FANTASTIC. Can't say enough good things about her. So nice, so patient, and so helpful.

The reason for the not-so-great review is that their delivery was late (really threw a wrench in our schedule the day before the wedding and made us scramble to get everything ready in time), but mainly because of the way they responded when some of their rentals were not in proper working order. Our caterer had requested that we order a large propane grill, which we did. Unfortunately, when she arrived to start cooking the day of our wedding (the day after the rentals were delivered), she found that the propane was leaking and only half of the grill was working. Our caterer was amazing and somehow still managed to get dinner done (later than planned, but what can you do with half a working grill when most of your menu is grilled?!), but it was a massive inconvenience. 

After the wedding, both the caterer and the venue owner told us they thought we should let the Party Place know about the problem, and they both expected they would be decent enough to offer us a refund for the cost of the grill, since it created such a problem on our wedding day. So we emailed them when we got the final bill and requested a refund for the grill... and about a week later got a response saying, ""I split the cost of the bbq with you since you did use 1/2 of it.  I am wondering if anyone called us when they found it wasn't working to see if we could trouble shoot over the phone and possibly help to have it fixed as it may have been something minor.""

I'm sorry, but we thought that response was really lame. Way to dodge taking responsibility for your malfunctioning equipment. No, our caterer didn't have a chance to call because she was working like mad trying to salvage our wedding dinner with half of your grill not working! And we were on a ranch with poor cell coverage (which we had notified your staff of ahead of time)!

But they don't live up to the $95 cost for 2 adults and 3 kids and 15 for slushies. It is our fault not grabbing the 10 coupons we later found in every guide.  
Part one, the monster truck tour. We went on OX. 
Critique one, get a good guide for the trucks,  The jungle cruise at Dw is scripted fun.  This is not. bits of interesting stuff,(like dw pays them to take waste from animal kingdom) but not enough. 
Critique two, spend some upkeep money on the trucks.  They were quick to tell us each truck cost 100 k. What have they done since? Idea would be fix  the seats, (all were falling apart) add a speaker system for the driver, and maybe add a few fans for days its hot as the sun like it was this past Wednesday. Given it was a full tour, this could be done!
Critique 3, when its this hot, why have the kids take turns driving the truck. Its cute but likely not the brightest thing to do anyway. 
Part two in the store:
friendly with samples, nice stuff to look at but my final critique is to clean up the place during the day.  We did try the Orange slushy and frozen berry lemonade.  Both were very good.  But when we sat outside to finish them, wrappers and cups were everywhere.

The slushy and the kids liking the trucks save a one star rating.  This could be a perennial 4 with an occasional 5 star as a repeat visit place  with some attention to detail.  I usually take a lot of pictures but did not post with this review.  That will keep this a half full review.",2.0

The menu is overpriced and limited.

The service was terrible (our waiter apparently had only been there 2 weeks but was unable to answer ANY of our simple questions about the menu). 

The food took  F O R E V E R ... and wasn't blow you out of the water good when it finally did come.

The varied music made the ambiance everything from french bistro to night club. OH and it plays VERY loudly in the bathrooms. Though the unisex bathroom thing - kinda cool I have to say.

They decided to ""air"" out the restaurant by leaving the front door open ... did I mention is was 40 degrees outside? When we asked if they could close it because we were chilled - the fashionable hostess said they were ""airing out the restaurant"" ... seriously?

On the upside they had yummy lemonade and pretty decor.

I am a wing lover and once I saw all the lovely flavors they had to offer I knew I had to try them out. I got extremely excited when I saw the ""hot lemon pepper"" flavor because I love hot wings and I love lemon pepper wings but I can never get them together. I was satisfied with the flavor but not with the size at all. I definitely prefer my wings to be a good size and these were like baby wings. Luckily I ordered 15 wings and smashed every single last one of them in one sitting. I normally would never have been able to do this so you can imagine how small they were. My girlfriend ordered old bay wings which are her favorite. She also ordered three ranches but instead received three blue cheeses which we absolutely hate. The server also called me lowkey rushing me asking if I was still coming. Mind you I'm from out of town and the highway was blocked off so I had to find my own way there without GPS.

829,LuaJQWGppIC04cOGUHhk0A,"Weekday lunch times are surprisingly quiet at NBC Sports Grill & Brew, at least in the two times that I've been here. They have two floors of seating, but the upstairs don't seem to be open for lunch. The food is pretty typical American fare. They try to make it a little more interesting with fusions of other cuisines, but in the end, it's all pretty standard.

My first meal here was the Bang-Bang Chicken. It was decent, but they doused the entire plate with overly toasted coconut shavings. I had to try to pick them out because even if you love coconuts, this was overwhelming. If you order this dish, be sure to ask for the coconuts to be on the side. My second meal here was one of the flatbreads. It was very average - not terrible, but not the greatest either.

They have a decent beer selection, and even one (or more?) that is specially brewed for them. For folks who are into craft beer, you will have some options, but probably not the most ideal if you're in the snobbier side of the craft beer spectrum. They also tend to be overpriced, but typical for its location.

Overall, not my first choice when it comes to the options at CityWalk, but not too bad either, especially if you're looking for standard American food while watching sports.",3.0
830,d1_J3MPijq8voBn32hsb_w,"So I was pumped to finally try snooze. I love brunch; t's my absolutely favorite. I also love fun eggs benedicts so thought this would be a treat.

We came 30 min to close and it was still packed. Fortunately, since everyone was leaving, we were seated within 10 min. It's a bright, fun, diner w 80s music pumping. It's Loud. Corn holes and giant jenga outside for those waiting. Cute ""fake grass"" seating area under trees in the back. Staff seemed friendly, dressed up in a pirate theme, and generally seemed to be enjoying themselves despite how busy it was. Love that. 

So onto the food and drink- Good:/bad/ugly: 

chile verde Benny was tasty. Loved the hash browns- but those didn't balance the dish and way too much. Hubs had the chilaquiles. It was ok, but we both preferred the chile verde.

Had a Palomimosa. Mmm, let's say I didn't finish it. 

Now the part that didn't sit well was the chilaquiles had nearly half a whole egg shell in the poached egg Bc my husband kept spitting out egg shells until he finally said something. (He's ridiculously patient.) he wanted to leave.

so I waited for our server who didn't come by for awhile and had to flag down someone else who got the manager. They of course apologized and remade the dish. It was out within 5 min and he finished the second in little time and no trouble.

The server we had- let's say- we can only assume she was probably having a bad day. She was the least happy person on the floor. Never smiled, was semi-attentive, made helpful suggestions but always curt, and seemed more annoyed w us after we spoke to the manager who came by to address the dish. Every other server and host seemed to love being there and had fun. Ours- not so much. 

They comped the dish without saying, which was nice. However, I'm not sure if it's worth the hype. If we had waited 1.5 hours (like everyone else has been) and had this happen to us~ we def would've rated the experience a 1 star.

836,RVUM71VQnJESi6U5wOw6RA,"Well Michelin, it is safe to say that you are indeed overrated and biased. A couple months back, I had the pleasure of going to the Water Grill in downtown Los Angeles, a restaurant that holds 1 Michelin star (at least when they had a Michelin guide in LA). It was very good, but in my opinion B&G Oysters is definitely better. We ended up at B&G at 5:30 on a Saturday (the only res we could get a week ahead of time). It seemed like a great place to take my aunt and uncle while they were in town doing touristy things. 

For our apps, we ordered the fried clams and the mussels.The fried clams were clearly pretty fresh and the dipping sauce was great. The mussels on the other hand were spectacular. We agreed that these were some of the most tender mussels that any of us had ever had, and they were quite flavorful as well. 

For our entrees, my aunt and uncle both ordered some fish that they had never tried before, ordered the salmon, and my girlfriend ordered the lobster roll. The lobster roll was quite good and very lightly dressed (the way I like it). She also had coleslaw and fries on the side. While the coleslaw was pretty standard, the fries were very good. I loved that they decided to opt for tarragon and cilantro on the fries. For my salmon, I have to say that this was easily the most crispy fish skin I have ever had on a piece of fish. The fish itself was quite tasty as well. Oh...and the sauce...the sauce, so good. The chorizo added an element of saltiness that I thought was welcome and often lacking from fish in restaurants. We opted to avoid dessert and go out for ice cream instead, but overall it was a fantastic experience. The service was generally good as well.

837,5LRXXGFmG9OAuy_tIXK9Eg,"Ok, I like this place. But since it's in the Good Food Here pod, that's pretty much a given.

I've tried 3 of the dishes, though I don't remember all of the specifics. One of them had sweet glazed pork, which I had never had before... but will definitely have again. Yum! For some of the dishes, the items are separated out on the plate, allowing you to add as much jalepeno or specific veggies as you want. 

For the meat dishes, I think the price is a bit steep  - $7.50 for a decent sized plate of food (the other northern Thai carts have bigger portions for this price). But the vegetarian dishes (or at least the pad dish that I had last time) are a dollar cheaper while still being just as tasty and filling. So as far as economical eating goes, the veg dishes are your best bet, but the other dishes are still really, really yummy - don't cross them off your list completely.",4.0

We sat at the bar and ordered the polla con camarones ajillo (chicken with garlic shrimp) and she had the fried pork.  The best thing about this meal was the Fried Yucca which we ordered a side of. The rest was MEH at best. 
One issue we had was actually getting our food. We were the first to sit at the bar top and order out of 7 people and the last to get our food. we were patient and we kept hearing (your food will be right out) but it took the longest out of the whole bar. We didnt complain nor brought any attention about it. When we got those dishes half was missing from each and took alittle additional time to get. 
The chicken with garlic shrimp lacked flavor. Not by alittle but by alot. I was hoping to taste garlic but we couldnt at all. The sauce was watery and lacked any consistency on what i would expect a sauce to be. We had 3 little ramekins of that garlic sauce and put it on everything. We both feel kinda queezie and now think those were bad. I didnt think of it at the time but the consistency of that garlic stuff was more on the thicker side (possible built up slimyness). thinking maybe it was in that bar fridge for too long. Her fried pork was okay but it too lacked seasoning. The rice and the Yucca are the reason why this place gets one star above the worst. Like i said i had eaten here before and it was great. I ordered the Bandeja and the blood sausage was my favorite. i think ill try this place again and chalk this one up as an anomaly.",2.0

Went there last night (12-08) to watch the  Christmas boats with some friends. 
When my wife went on line for reservations she asked for window seating so we could see the boats.
We got there at 7:30 and the boats come back by around 8ish so we figured no prob....
We walked in on the bar side and saw that the place was packed. Some woman said ""just try to find a seat anywhere"". 
We said we had reservations so she said to go thru the bar and around to the dining room. Whilst walking behind the bar area I was hit with this foul odor comparable to cat urine.....it made my eyes water.(still we decided to stay)
We get to the waiters podium and tell the we have reservations for a window seating. 
Our waiter takes us up a stairway and past the cooks line in front of the kitchen and seat us in a boothlike arrangement that is only seperated from the kitchen with a curtain (CLASSY) By the end of the meal my wife felt that she was cooked to perfection.
We were up in the nosebleed section and could barely see out the windows across the dining room.
The waiter coudn't even get our drink order right 4 diet cokes a sprite and 5 waters.c'mon it was as if I wasn't there he just glossed over me......
No appetizer(couldn't really decide) they have alot of oyster choices.
3 of us ordered the beer cheese soup one seafood chowder and one spinach salad. 
We all enjoyed the soup , it's a little bitter at first but the cheese on is really good.
My friends chowder was so small so I really don't know if he had gotten a good taste of it.
The spinach salad had some odd white stuff on it that didn't taste right (daikon perhaps??)
I had the arctic char .....It was crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside ( the way it should be) It came with shrimp risotto which was mushy like oatmeal.
My sister in law had the chicken marsala which was dry and she said the mashed potatoes tasted ""fishy"".
Wy wife had the filet mignonettes which were a little fatty but otherwise unremarkable.
My other friend had the tilapia and although it didn't taste fishy it tasted deep fried. 
Dessert was blah my wife and I had the marrion berry pie which was dry. My friends pumpkin cheesecake was nothing to brag about.

854,Rsg8PbG2BgJi3NWOU5OEBw,"Channing is a photo ninja.

My parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted.  The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.

That wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.

And the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.

Seeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.

Finally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.

So yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.",5.0

To contextualize at the risk of sounding pretentious, this is Italian food as served in Italy, rather than ""American Italian"" food, which is really a spin on nineteenth century regional (southern) Italian food with ingredient substitutions based on what was available to impoverished immigrants on the Lower East Side. Emphasis here seems to be on selecting superb quality fresh ingredients and putting them together in interesting and mildly experimental ways. I've never eaten better spinach than that which formed the base of my spinach salad, neither eaten a more comforting dish of gnocchi anywhere west of Sorrento. Just what the doctor ordered on a 20 degree Portland evening. I tend to benchmark Italian restaurants by the quality of the gnocchi; here served with pesto and crisp pancetta; just perfect.

The service was very friendly and helpful, but a little slow. They comped my wife's cocktail when it arrived a course too late. The ambience is really wonderful, reminds me of little restaurants in my home town of Brighton, bijou, full of character and knick-knacks. Intimate, homely and relaxed.

870,u_8VEN5SzxQpnK2xH7cvOA,"This cute little restaurant is in my neighbourhood and I jumped to buy their 6 course menu for 2 on Living Social. I've read previous reviews that people actually wait for these coupons for Mis trucos because it seem they do them often. That is definitely not a good reputation to have, but I do agree that their portions are kind of small and you do need many dishes to be satisfied.

After reading reviews of how previous coupon-ers were ill treated, I made sure to not book my reso through Open Table and call in for a reservation to state that I had a coupon for 2 six course tastings. I thought they wanted this because I bet they changed the items that went on the menu to accommodate for the cheaper coupon. This wasn't so as we were serve exactly what was on the chalkboard wall for the 6 course taster - except for the dessert which apparently they ran out of.

Agree with past reviews that food does not come out hot, but lukewarm. Sous vide chicken was barely palatable at room temperature, which wasn't that well seasoned, although the quinoa with apricots and almonds on which it was served was perfect. (5th course)

1st course was a shot of gazpacho with spot prawn and avocado. Latter could have been more ripe, which would have added better richness and sweetness. 

2nd was amazing - a parma ham with caramelized onions and red pepper, topped with a 60 degree poached egg, making it not runny, but more jelly like in consistency. It was amazing tasting, although points off for messy presentation (runny egg white outside of where the egg even was). This was also served room temp.

3rd was the risotto. I was sad to see that it was a truffle risotto instead of lobster, but in a 6 course tasting that was so cheap, it's udnerstandable (their lobster risotto is amazing). I think I make pretty amazing mushroom truffle risotto myself, and I have to say mine might be a tiny bit better. Their rice was too al dente. Truffle flavour was there, but not amazing.

4th course was the fish - a tiny piece, but it was simply seared with a crispy skin. Accompaniments weren't memorable. 

5th course was chicken which I mentioned earlier in lukewarmness.

6th was dessert and was supposed to be a chocolate mousse which the boyfriend was looking forward to, but they arrived with a rhubarb sauced rice pudding instead, with no mention to the change on the blackboard or to us, until something different was served to us. The rhubarb sauce was yummy nonetheless, and I appreciate the local seasoned produce addition, although again the rice was hard and it felt like it had been in the fridge for a while. Definitely not made that day. 

Shared a pitcher of sangria for 17 bucks and that was quite yummy, albeit a tad watered down. 

All in all, it was a good experience and wish I could give it 3 and a half stars. Yes the furniture, pitcher, glasses, silverware and lots of other things are from Ikea, but the boyfriend noted it's kind of a cool thing that you can open a restaurant on the cheap because you're passionate about food. yes, but I wish the delicious food was actually made fresh and served at a good temperature!

They even package up your cupcake in an equally cute little box. The red velvet cupcake is by far my favorite. I have yet to try a ""dry"" cupcake that many have complained about, but I usually get the red velvet... they seem to have the recipe pretty down pat. I especially love the cream cheese frosting, which has a really nice consistency and subtle flavors (I despise the in-your-face cream cheese taste on cupcakes). 
I also love the ingenuity of their ""frosting shots"" which let you try the varieties of frosting (buttercream, cream cheese, or whipped cream) for a taste of a little something sweet. 
Expect to drop a pretty penny on one of these goodies though. If you ask me, you're partly paying for the experience of eating such a decadent yummy in trendy Harvard Square.

882,jN0IbsDdE53NVjzr3wKkdw,"I had a very painful experience with Sixt. I strongly advise against going with Sixt to try to save money, because you might end up wasting a bunch of your time with bad customer service. Sixt went against our original reservation agreement before when picking up the car, and also made a bunch of mistakes with incorrect additional fees.

Car reservation:
I had made a reservation for a car over the phone for an agreed amount of around $299, to pick up at the Kissimmee Sixt location. As I was on a lyft ride on the way to pick up the car from the Kissimee Sixt location, I got a call from Sixt saying that there are no more cars left at Kissimmee and that they changed my reservation to be at Orlando, and that the amount is changed to $500+. I actually received this phone call a few minutes AFTER the time I was supposed to be picking up the car. I tried to argue that I shouldn't have to pay any more than I agreed to, as I reserved a car for a fixed amount. They wouldn't budge. So I ended up having to pay for the lyft to go to the Orlando location when we were already almost at the Kissimmee location. After some negotiating at the Orlando location, they lowered the amount from $500+ to $372, which was still $72 more than the original reservation agreement over the phone.

Incorrect fees:
After having rented the car, we received a summary of invoice charging us an extra day for the rental. We had to call and email them numerous times to correct this mistake. In doing so, they also took off the daily express toll charge, which covered for all the tolls on the freeway, when we never asked them to. They never even gave us an invoice showing that the daily express toll charge had been removed. A few weeks later, they charged us $175 for the tolls because they took off the daily toll charge. That was a huge pain, because we had to call/email to argue that Sixt made the mistake by taking off that toll charge when we never asked them to. Eventually, they refunded us for the $175 that they charged for the toll roads. 

It took a month and a half to resolve all the issues we had with this car rental, and it was just a lot of work and time wasted dealing with customer service and silly mistakes on Sixt's end.",2.0

Chicken feet was very good- big portion and cooked so tender. The egg white scallop fried rice was a little on the dry side but still very good.
Service was less than stellar to at the least. No one was available when we wanted some sauce to dip in, since nothing was provided at all in the first place. Took another ten min to flag someone down to pay.

Especially when I am there with a group larger than two people, I feel as though I am inconveniencing the waitstaff with my presence. I find myself going out of MY way to be polite to the staff to try to make the situation less uncomfortable. This has happened four times now.

Last night about six of us were sat outside and waiting for one more guest to arrive, and our server wouldn't even let us order drinks. He said, ""that's not how this works. You wait for everyone before you order with me."" Are you kidding me? If that's the house rule, then don't let us sit down with an incomplete party. That would be perfectly fine.

I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly. I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on. No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms. Once I am ready to check out, I go to registers up front. No one was up there either so I wait. A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me, just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up. I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase. She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her. She looked at it and then says ""i'll be right back"". I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up. She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get. I pick about 10 up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me. After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion. She said, ""I think we have the space blue"".

Pros -
Traditional irish pub feel
Diverse menu
Live music
Kitchen open until 10
Always people inside to drink with

Cons -
Not pub prices
Food is disappointing
*Burgers, sadly, are nothing special. Somewhat dry and sad-looking.
*Pub chips are just standard deep-fried frozen bag french fries
*Ketchup tastes funky... don't know how else to put it
*Seafood was a little bit... hard to eat
Service was less than cheery. Would like to get at least one smile at an Irish pub
*This is, of course, a small sample size and not gospel for your mileage

Any other place in the area I would give 2 stars for my experience. Because this is a genuine Irish pub that adds a needed social element to the neighborhood with live music and a constant scene, I give it an A-OK.",3.0

We really wanted to like this place, and as others have mentioned, the smoky aroma of the barbecued meat was so enticing we decided to give it a try.  SO disappointed! Beef ribs (2 of them) we're tough and had very little meat.  Hush puppies were dry and over-fried but the cornbread was decent.  Pork ribs (2 1/2 of those) we're also dry and gnarly.  Mac and cheese was cheesy, but the macaroni was all coagulated, and overall the dish lacked flavor.  As for the coleslaw, what in the world was that sickeningly sweet dressing?? Please add some vinegar, a bit if salt, some pepper, maybe some celery seeds...something to provide some flavor beyond the sweetness.

We left feeling like we were ripped off. Certainly didn't get our money's worth. Bottom line: if you're going to run a rib joint those had better be the best darn ribs in town if you want people to come back and/or recommend your place.",2.0

916,RUFCbF7hJlmxLXav2d2GGQ,"Went in for a consultation in October 2016. It'd been 3 years since seeing a dentist and I wanted to start getting back on track. Staff was nice, but very busy. Got x-rays, had an exam with a hygienist, all was fine. The dentist then came in, looked at my x-rays and my permanent retainers (top and bottom) and said that he wanted to take the retainers out. Okay, that was fine, I was interested. The only problem, he said, was that due to shorter roots on one of my lower incisors, I was likely to lose a tooth. This apparently didn't faze him.

He started talking about bridges and implants, then asked if I knew what a veneer was. I said no, and he directed the nurse to show me a video on it, then left. With no further explanation, I was forced to watch a video of a veneer being installed, in extreme close-up. If you don't know what a veneer is, it's when your teeth are all ground down and they install 3/4 crowns on all of your teeth. Watching teeth being ground down is basically a scene from a horror movie. I was pretty appalled. Following that, they showed me an estimate for the removal of the permanent retainers (fairly inexpensive), a bridge (very expensive), and a night guard (very expensive), totaling nearly $4k. I left, shaken and convinced that I was going to lose a tooth and a LOT of money.

I ended up getting a second opinion at Conway Dental Care (to which I have now transferred). The dentist there asked if I had any pain (something the dentist at Bright Now didn't bother asking), and I said no. ""If it's not broken, don't fix it"" he said, after inspecting the retainers to make sure they actually weren't broken. He said that I just need to come in for a regular cleaning and they'll be fine. This was an immense relief that my new dentist didn't pressure me into getting a needless procedure that risks losing my teeth!

TLDR: Be careful with Bright Now - while the people who work there are plenty nice, the dentist will likely recommend unnecessary procedures without regard to your comfort, just to make a buck. Beware of large clinics. Get second opinions when you can.

Also: I can't speak to the quality of their work, as I have not had any work done here, just got scared off by their consultation.",2.0

As a Watertown resident, I have driven by this place a million times and walked by often on the way to Super Fusion for sushi and the Meat Spot for my fav parma sub.  Anywho, I finally decided to stop into this bakery.  It is a cute little place with baked goods and a small grocery section.

I have a particular weakness to Macaroons and this place makes a killer Walnut and Almond version.  I have tried a bunch of items with mixed results, not every item is always fresh, so you may want to stick to the popular items.

918,VyL_58Hgtix73QFUAdfTbA,"Well, a friend recommended coming here since it was newer to the area. I am always looking for a fun new breakfast place to meet with friends.

The atmosphere was a nice quiet, but welcoming to group conversations. The hostess and waitress were both great. Made sure we had everything we needed even before we had opened our menus. Offered fresh orange juice before we even sat down. I was impressed and ready to look at the menu.

Right away I noticed the jelly jar sitting on the table and wondered if they made their own jam or jelly. Looked over the menu and decided to go with the sausage omelet with red potatoes and biscuits on the side. I figured I had to try their biscuits since the restaurant has it in the name.

The omelet was a good portion, I couldn't finish all of it. The red potatoes were a little greasy and a few too many spices thrown in. Sometimes less is more. I was disappointed with the biscuits. I was hoping to have a fresh home made tasting and looking biscuits. Instead I received what was probably a refrigerated pre-made biscuit that was a little dry on the outside. The jam was tasty though.

Overall, it seems to be a great place to join with friends for breakfast. I didn't look over their lunch menu, but they do offer it. If I do go back again, I think I will try maybe one of their seasonal pancakes that changes each month.",3.0

The over all atmosphere was  ritzy, nice, and very clean. The movie was displayed nicely and the seats were very cushiony and comfortable. I didn't realize I paid for the cheaper seats that do not offer food service and that was really inconvenient. The lady at the front told me I could order at my seat but I guess she was wrong. I had four kids with me and my husband had to stay with them while I brought out food for everyone...I felt like I was interrupting other people....and I missed a lot of the movie. Our dinner, dessert, Alcohol, and tickets added up to $230. An employee whom I believe was a manger, saw me carrying a lot of food on my own so he offered to help, which was very nice of him but when I grabbed the tray from him half of my 15$ pizza fell on the floor and they didn't offer to bring out a replacement, that made me upset. I spent a lot of money with them and he saw I was struggling, I just think that they should have done something about it. Another thing I really didn't like...I saw him touch his face at the food counter and then pick up some fries it his bare hands and place them in our dish. They hype up the food with the names and the price as if your getting some amazing gourmet meal, and don't get me wrong they also present it well, but it was like cafeteria grade food if you get what I mean....not good...not worth those outrages prices.

928,7BaISZVuvF_S8ERqn7DG1A,"We tried Exit for the first time with a bunch of friends and while it was fun, it has a lot of room for improvement. The theme of our experience was lack of directions from finding the location to the actual game.

For one thing, the address on the site doesn't direct you to the place. We were driving out from Chilliwack and were not familiar with the Richmond area and had to find the place ourselves using our reasoning since the GPS didn't guide us to it properly. We joked around about how this was the first puzzle to decipher - how to actually find the place. 

Once we got in, the girl that was telling us the rules spoke way too quick and her directions were very unclear and confusing. We were booked for the Egypt room. For one thing, she told us we weren't supposed to touch the props and some of the main clues were hidden inside the props on the ground (in the skulls for example). Our group was quite confused and by the time we started to actually get a feel of things and figured out how things were supposed to work (in the 2nd room) like how  we could touch the props and that it was actually a pretty important part of the game - our time was up. 

It was almost as if that was a strategy on part of the EXIT staff - to be as unclear as possible so as to leave you completely confused about how the game is supposed to be played, so you'd want to go again. That's why I gave it a 2 star. I feel like a much more clear and precise  directions would be helpful in making the game more fun. And maybe have the game be 1 hr instead of 45 min, so you really feel like you're getting your moneys worth.",2.0
929,ddiE5wz8Yp9DTRO6kzQk8Q,"Let me begin by saying, if I were to rate the food that we received, it would have been four stars.  The pasta dish was well executed, the lobster roll was well done, and the oysters were of course well presented and great.

What landed this restaurant a one star review was the general operation of the place.  We came in at 9:00 and understand that it's a hour before close, but after a $200 dinner for two we don't expect to be rushed past a reasonable pace.  We ordered 12 oysters, 6 cherry stones, a bottle of rose and two entrees.  We never got our clams with the oysters.  I assumed they would come as a mid course, but our entrees arrived and they were forgotten about.  Since we didn't want to let our food die in the kitchen while we waited for our clams, we didn't say anything at the time.  Maybe the server just forgot and they wouldn't be on the check.  

Towards the end of finishing our entrees, the cooks in the kitchen started loudly cleaning up, and using pungent chemicals.  They were just throwing every metal thing they could find into a metal receptacle on the floor.  Imagine how loud that would be when you are 4 feet away from it.  It didn't make for a very relaxing expierience, and certainly made us feel rushed, like they just wanted to get out of there.  On top of it they were using a strong smelling chemical to clean the fryer while there were guests in the restaurant.  The aroma of the boiling fryer did not complement out nice bottle of french rose.  

When the check came my girlfriend was so disappointed with the expierience that I didn't want to make it worse by getting into a conversation about paying for the 6 clams we didn't get.  It's too bad that this night went this way, because we love the menu and open kitchen concept of B&G.  We will most likely not be returning, when there are so many other options like ICOB, and Select that do it right, and think about guest expierience.  All of the other restaurants in this group are great, and hope B&G can once live up to to Barbara's reputation at some point.

Upon getting home, I was astonished to find that our chicken katsu orders were merely chicken; no sauce had been included. 

Frustrated, I drove back to the restaurant to get the rest of my dinner. After waiting awkwardly for a number of minutes, I asked for the containers of sauce to accompany the rest of our dinner. Instead of receiving an apology for the omission of the katsu sauce, it was explained that ""some customers don't like it"", so it wasn't included, even as a side.

We arrived a couple minutes after 6:30 and were told it would be about 10 minutes. Our thinking was 'no big deal, it's busy.' Well, 35 minutes and a complaining stop to the host stand later, we were finally seated.

The food was ok- about what you'd expect from a Japanese steak house. The hibachi dinners start with soup (broth with a few green onions and pieces of tofu) and salad (with ginger dressing and bacon bits). You also get a few pieces of shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables and rice (I always get the fried rice). I got the kobe (steak) and chicken, while my husband got steak and lobster with a thick, creamy sauce.

942,MjsZqd4_N_GkA9wHtQjscg,"THEY STOLE OUR FOOD, LITERALLY!

I don't know what to say, this was the plot for a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode but it happened to us the other day at Amrhein's.  We were celebrating my dad's birthday and went out to eat a family meal.  My brother ordered the Lobster Mac n Cheese and went with a full order (this cost $24).  One thing you have to understand about my brother is that he is built like a stick, he decided to get the full order because he could bring the leftovers home with him.

So the end of the meal rolls around and both myself and him decided to take the rest of our food back.  I ordered the Pumpkin Risotto and also had a fair amount left on the plate.  We ask the waitress to pack our leftovers and she comes back with a plastic bag containing the leftovers in two boxes.  We never opened the leftovers at the restaurant to check, I mean why would we?  I guess we were naive to assume that the restaurant would give us the food we paid for.

We came home and decided to put the food away in the fridge.  That's when we noticed that the box containing my brothers food was tiny, compared to mine.  This was despite the fact that his portion was much larger and he barely ate a quarter of it.  It was at that point we realized that  either the waiter or the kitchen staff had basically taken my brothers leftovers for themselves and put a skimpy serving in a small take out box.

I hope this is clear.  THEY TOOK OUR LEFTOVERS FOR THEMSELVES!  WHO DOES THAT?

We are joking about how this plot mirrored a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode and then we decided to go on Yelp and see if anyone else had a similar experience.  I have not read a review like this yet, but there are plenty of 1-2 star ratings, we ended up learning about other shady practices such as not honoring vouchers and not giving customers back exact change (i.e. rounding off totals for themselves).  To be honest I don't think the whole thing about the change is that big a deal, but when I compared that to the experience we just had I couldn't believe that this restaurant continues to be in operation.

It was a hot summer night, and there's no ventilation inside the restaurant. It's like a sauna in there -- we walked in, and almost walked right out. If it weren't for the fact that a table for two was available right away, we probably would have left. Maybe we should have.

We ordered the chicken liver with capers crostini ($6) which was just ok. It was basically pate, and I like pate, but I was expecting chicken livers -- something a little bit different from pate smeared on toast. Capers were fried beyond recognition or taste.

When the caprese (buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes & basil, $10) arrived, we nearly gasped. The portion was so small, given the price -- maybe 5 cherry-size tomatoes sliced in half, with a chunk of cheese. It tasted okay, but not worth $10.

When the pancetta (and... I can't remember) pizza ($15) arrived, we actually gasped out loud because nearly half of the pizza's surface was charred black. We looked up at the waitress, and asked in disbelief, ""is it supposed to be this burned?"" She sheepishly answered yes, but offered to do it again if we didn't like it. Uh huh. 

When she took it back to the man-in-charge-of-pizza (not the owner-chef) standing no more than 10 feet away, he angrily tossed the whole pie into the trash. It took another 15 minutes for the replacement to arrive, and though not charred on top, the bottom was still severely burnt black. I don't know -- crispy is one thing, but why would I pay money to eat soot?

The pancetta was super salty, as pancetta can be, but there was nothing else on the pizza to offset or balance the saltiness. It was almost inedible, but we were so hungry by then. In short, the pizza was a disaster.

In conclusion. Strike 1: I was fanning my face with the menu the whole time because it was so unbearably hot in there. Strike 2: The Caprese is a ripoff. Strike 3. When the table next to us cleared, a waitress used a scented chemical-smelling cleaning spray and a rag to wipe it down, and we had to sit for the rest of the evening smelling Pinesol-like fumes. Strike 4. They had the audacity to serve us a $15 pizza that should have gone into the trash to begin with.

So nope. We're not going back. Probably ever.",2.0

958,g6Q84u4d5EB8rvqj5Fmmjw,"Visited Flip Burger on Thursday evening for dinner. Upon entering there was no one to get us seated, waited for five minutes & then went up to the bar to figure out if we need to just grab a table. Finally found someone who walked us over to our table. We decided on sitting outside on a perfect Summer evening. 

Service was extremely poor, in fact for the first 20 minutes there was no one who even checked in to see if we wanted to order drinks / appetizers. There were 2 servers attending the outside tables, we noticed 2 other tables which were seated after us who were attended (they got their drinks) & we were still waiting for our waiter to take our order for drinks. 

Ordered beer & onion rings to start - took another 20 minuets to bring the first beer. Our burgers came right along with the appetizer. Wanted a second round of beer - received that after our dinner was done. 

Finally got tired waiting so had to go up to the counter to get the check - at which point our server showed up stating that he was extremely busy & apologized.

959,paYw3DCOjo6zNiWYe-yTRg,"We've had friends talk this place up to us for years, and finally they dragged us along for dinner a few weeks ago.  I am so very glad they did.

We had reservations, and though I don't think we needed them, we were seated promptly and the host was a pretty funny guy.  Our server was pretty awesome too - he kept us taken care of and in drinks the whole evening.  

For appetizers, our friends ordered the curried mussels with a side of naan, and I, not a huge mussel fan, decided to order the hummus and naan combo.  Once they brought both plates, I figured out that I don't mind mussels at all if they are coated IN THE SAUCE OF LOVE.  I would bathe in this sauce if I could.  Our server tried to take it away once the mussels were gone and we pretty much slapped his hand and just asked for MOAR NAAN.  

For dinner, we all ordered a hodge podge of food and went for it family style.  The mixed grill from the tandoor was probably actually my least favorite, some of the meat was a little chewy, but saying that, it was still pretty good.  The Goan Yellow Curry with shrimp was a surprise standout for me - I'm usually not that much into those coconuty flavors as I just want some spice, but it was a perfect balance.  The vindaloo had good flavor, but didn't kill us.  And, the saag paneer was solid.  Creamy, cheesy, tasty.

I'm not entirely sure how we also put desert in our faces, but we shared some rice pudding (kheer), carrot cake w/ice cream (Gajjar Halwa), and the standout for me was the little donuts in the fried sauce of peace and harmony (Gulab Jamun).  

All in all, a super fun night with friends, a good date night place for sure.  Although, if Clay Pit had to have a tag line for me, it would be...

This is definitely a suitable replace for many of us that are too lazy to leave the building for lunch. The service has always been efficient and friendly to me.

My fave things that set out from all the burger joints popping up are the tater tots (regular or sweet potato) and the homemade buns (not THE Actual Wahlberg buns).

Simple setup inside with hints of Dorchester and all the famous Wahlberg Movies and photos to make it a la Planet Hollywood.  To the left, a full service restaurant and then to the right, quick take out.  Simple layout of a menu, choose your meat, toppings and side.

The catfish was ok but a very small filet. The other person ordered a seafood pizza. It was extremely salty. Told the server and he just says ...sorry....and walks away.

966,jUmSVidkuXT9q-TH3FZO6A,"I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! 

I think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.
I tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.
I had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.
But the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.
This was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.
I literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.

On a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check.

The menu was surprisingly impressive- and I felt a slight anxiety trying to decide what to order. I finally decided to stop looking at the menu and just order on impulse. I ended up ordering their Chicken Pot Pie, but of course it was a little bit more upscale. The bread brought to the table beforehand was absolutely delicious- but I was hesitant to ask for more, was that allowed?

The meal itself was good- but there were a few parts that just missed the mark. I was disappointed that the carrots in the pot pie were raw- maybe they wanted to add a crunch, but it really just destroyed the taste/texture of the overall dish. Also, the hericot verts side was so vinegary that I really couldn't eat it. But why I'm a fan- is definitely the atmosphere, friendly staff and the potential of the menu- which I am certain I will be trying again very soon.

NOPE. It's some kind of spicy chilly breaded shrimp. Was quite spicy btw. I'm currently pregnant so my taste buds have to be craving spicy in order to eat it & today was not the day.

974,tx8tO7H45LTmPtPlVFneGg,"Just tried this restaurant for the first time. It was pretty good. The others in my party enjoyed their meals and apps quite a bit. Maybe it's because I eat out so often, but I just felt this is yet another in a long list of ""American (New)"" restaurants around town, and not necessarily much better than any of the others. Thinking of trendy places these others come to mind - Osprey Tavern, TR Fire Grill, Soco, Firebirds - to name a few. This is about the same as those. All of these seem to have spawned off the original idea from Ravenous Pig many years ago. 

There's a burger, some locally sourced fish and vegetables. There are also craft prohibition style cocktails. Of course Luke's has some nicer things too, but their menu didn't really showcase this. I do have to tip my hat to the restaurant for having some lovely non-soda non-alcoholic beverages including Mint Sage Lemonade. I did enjoy that quite a bit.

Our server was so nice. His name was Anderson. After we placed our drink order it really seemed to take a while for everything to come out. This was not Anderson's fault as I could see him anxiously hanging around our table hoping we weren't going to ask where the drinks were. He finally decided to come over and tell us about almost every dish on the menu at length as a way to kill time until the drinks arrived.

This honestly helped bring the possible choices to life since the menu had very limited descriptions of the dishes. For example, a French Onion Soup with Gruyere was listed, but Anderson told us that it also has braised oxtail. Not sure why they would omit that from the description. They also, according to Anderson, have a long list of dry aged steaks including Wagyu beef but you have to ask for the list. 

The food was good but not great in my opinion. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I ordered the Tomato Salad because I love tomatoes. I also was under the impression that there would be Bleu cheese. Not really so. There was a Bleu cheese dressing. Extra points for the fact that it was made in house, but it really got lost in all the other flavors. The bacon confit in the salad was nice but not really enough for me to want to eat it over and over again.

Others in my party had the burger and the mussels. Once again I don't think the menu was clear on what you were actually getting, as the mussels had a very faint licorice flavor in the sauce (perhaps Pernod) that I don't think was shared in the description. Nothing bad just unexpected. 

As others have stated the parking is pretty much valet only - unless you come before 6-6:30. They could rethink this honestly.

Everyone in my party enjoyed their dishes and made hints at wanting to come back, so maybe I'm just being picky. If this were the only restaurant in town with this type of menu I would definitely come back, but with so many other easier options I don't see myself coming here that often.",3.0

So we headed over the bar, ordered a drink, and waited.

After 10 minutes, we got a bowling lane, shoes, and played 3 games.  The unfortunate part was that even though this place was busy, there was not a single server that came to get us drinks.  I ended up needing another drink, so while my friend went outside to smoke, I went to the bar to order two more drinks.

I waited probably 10 minutes to be served, and it wasn't busy.  They had one bartender for this huuuuge and long bar, and the cash register and MICROS machine was waaaay at the other end, where no one was sitting.  So, 10 minutes to get two drinks 4 PM on a Saturday.

Since it cost 25 bux for 2 of us to play 2 games, I would have expected things to work better.  Our lane broke down twice.  I had to walk all the way over to the busy desk to get help (there's no HELP ME button on the terminals there).  Many of the runner lights alongside the lanes were burnt out.  

The whole thing was just sort of ghetto, considering this place charges a premium.

Bathroom was DISGUSTING.  It's 4 PM and there's no one there, how is that possible?  Just HIRE someone to be in charge of keeping it fresh... most of the stalls were hands-down *unusable*.  Grossssss....

Needs more staffing.  Even though this place is ""prettier and sexier"" than King's, I think I'll try King's again next time.  King's is more down to earth, and I've always had excellent service there, and I've been there about 10 times.",2.0

1. They include a 20% service fee in your check which is okay by itself but then they also include tip suggestions like most places which can be deceiving since you might end up tipping twice in a not so full service place.

Second, this is in a lot of ways a classically American Chinese joint, replete with the metal teapot and Chinese zodiac placemats, but the manager'll be quick to point out some more old school home-style Chinese stuff posted on the desk. 

Food is pretty mediocre. The ""chicken velvet"" is some kind of egg concoction that everyone around us seemed to be ordering but was seriously undersalted. The dan dan noodles were cooked too al dente and they used too much vinegar.

I did find the manager sweet though--he was so excited to have Chinese people come. And he seemed so wistful as he stared out into the neon glow of the McDonalds opposite, hands loosely held behind his back like my old painting teacher.

This place is great when there's a wait at Tomo (sushi place right next door). The service is top notch, and selection is great. Unfortunately most of food just isn't that great.

If you need a thai fix it may suffice but it's nothing crave-able about the fare they serve. There is a lunch special that comes with free appetizer buffet. It's a great deal if you're looking to save some cash, but again the food is only meh.

This Sweet Tomatoes is located at the end of a lack-luster shopping center, so it can be difficult to find if you've never been here.  But once you walk inside, you are greeted by the salad buffet and a carpet with tomatoes printed on it (these people take their veggies seriously!).

You choose your salads and toppings prior to paying.  Patrons sit themselves in either tables or booths and the soups, bakery options, pasta, fresh fruit and ice cream are located in the back and you can go up as many times as you want to sample the many fresh and yummy offerings.

My favorite part of the buffet are the soups and pastas - so many choices - creamy and cheesey gooey macaroni and cheese and two other options that change every so often!  Also, there are certain soups and salads highlighted (and changed) each month.  For instance, in March, the theme is Latin flavors.  The bread options are abundant as well.  For example, when I last went to Sweet Tomatoes, there were four types of Focaccia bread (and they all had some type of cheese on them, so of course, I had to try them all!), muffins and biscuits.

Pros: conveniently located. run-of-the-mill pizza if you like uninteresting pizza. Acceptable meatball sub. I don't remember what I thought of anything else I tried there and maybe that means something. 

Cons: run-of-the-mill pizza. uninterested staff. There's no love in this place--they've been doing it for a long time and they obviously don't think about customers anymore.

First of all, its none of her business to comment on the fact that I dont work. She asked if I had the day off of work (it was Presidents Day) and I casually mentioned that ""I always have off of work"" and tried to change the subject..... but she proceeded to bombard me questions for the next 30 minutes regarding my lack of employment. Comments from ""oh, your husband must do really well""... to ""oh, so why dont you have kids, then?"" (again, NONE OF HER BUSINESS to ask that). It was incredibly rude and completely unprofessional. 

Then, when I went to pay, she noticed my Chanel wallet and said ""oh! when you're ready to get rid of that, give it to me!"" Again, just not okay and so very unprofessional. 

Im sure she wasnt trying to be rude, but she was talking to me like we had been friends for years and I just met this women. Not okay.  

I wont be back. Its a shame too because I was a regular customer for awhile; but I wont subject myself to a strange and uncomfortable experience like that again. I felt judged and disrespected.

All of our silverware was covered with grease (a lot of grease, not just a little sheen). My wife's fork and spoon was covered with tiny food particles.

This particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations.  We arrived and the parking situation is not that great, you share a public parking garage and it costs $22 per night with no valet. It's hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking. You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors.

Worse yet, when I have nine stamps, and then order two drinks, getting the stamp for one and then using the full card to pay for the other, she gets angry at me and accuses me of somehow doing something wrong.

I often pass by this place when I go on my runs around the park, and I've always been skeptical about the quality of food that they serve. This just seemed like another one of those gimmicky lakeside places that take advantage of the nice scenery to serve up subpar food. Well, I was only half right. 

Let me start out by saying that they make everything fresh. Nothing is frozen or pre-made, so it takes a lot longer for your food to be brought out. Not only this, but they don't have a wide selection of beers. I don't mind waiting long for my food if I've got something good to drink, but none of the beers were turning me on. 

I decided to try the pink riesling, the buffalo chicken wrap with curly fries, and I stole some of my bf's chicken fingers. Now, I really like the pink riesling. It was sweet and not too dry. It was pretty good. Then I went for my main. The curly fries were great. I really liked them. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The buffalo chicken wrap, although the waitress claimed it to be a crowd fave, was not my fave. Too much cheese, chicken was a little dry, but felt really watery from the buffalo sauce, just not that great. The chicken fingers were great though. They were so juicy and tender. You could really tell that they made them to order. I also tried a bit of the spinach artichoke dip and it was alright. I've had better.

Food is the cheapest cost at a restaurant so there's no excuse to be so stingy.  The $23 tortellini had 8 tortellinis.  They call it a 'light summer dish'.  It's not like they are identifying themselves as tapas either.  It seems they serve very little food so you aren't so full that you don't order dessert.  But I think after having 3 appetizers and 2 main dishes and having so little food actually served, we were ready to get out of there and have an actual meal.

Also, the caesar salad, while a decent salad, was not what one would call caesar.  The croutons were rock hard.  It came with one (pickled!) anchovy, and the dressing seemed more olive oil and lemon juice and nothing else.  A light salad, but certainly not caesar.

I ordered the Tamago (Egg) Ra-men that's featured on the menu cover and requested the spicy version. I am not a ramen aficionado by any means but I have to say it was tres delicious.

In fact,  I'm going to go out on a limb and say I definitely now prefer Ramen with chicken base over the regular pork base.

I was a tad thrown by the whole brown egg that came in the dish and at first thought it was still in the shell but it wasn't.  Biting into it and getting the partially soft yolk was a sublime moment.

I chose this spot from Grub Hub delivery.  My delivery options are quite limited in the new neighborhood so I couldn't believe my luck as I read the menu for this place.  I thought I must be dreaming as I read all of the delicious sounding items, and I triple checked to make sure they delivered.  Reasonably priced, and they were open. Great!  

I place my order.  2 hours later, no food.  I call, and a young lady says that it's coming up now. Wth??! After I protest, she offers me a lemonade. Blank stare. Go figure.  Finally, about 20 minutes later, food arrives.

Here's the kicker- the food was actually GOOD.  The breakfast potatoes I got were downright DELICIOUSLY spicy and tasty, with the bell peppers and onions perfectly grilled.  I had ordered a turkey and cheese with EXTRA mayo, lettuce, tomato, and ONION, CUT in HALF. They sent a sandwich with NO mayo and not cut.  I am very picky, hence the reason I take the time to very carefully specify how I would like my food prepared.  When it is nothing like I ordered, it signifies to me that I am not important enough for you to even care about TRYING to prepare my meal the way I asked (and paid) you to do it. FAIL.

Turns out, the sandwich was very good, the bread was perfectly soft, but the lack of care in preparation means I'll NEVER have another one.  Plus, had I not had Hellman's in the fridge, we would have had a REAL problem, as I don't do sandwiches with no mayo. Period.

The owner called me when Grub Hub called her, and explained that she is a ""full service"" restaurant, and she does the delivery orders ""when she can fit them in"". Had this been my establishment, I would have comped this entire meal for goodwill, and offered to try and get it right on a different day, thus ensuring a second visit from a first time patron/new neighbor/potential regular (I eat out 6 of 7 days a week, most unfortunately).

They were super-flavorful and he really liked them too. My sangria was fruity and refreshing, and not too strong. Overall, the food flavors and presentations are excellent, and portions are about right for the money. We left full but not stuffed, and even took home some leftovers.

The space is decorated beautifully, and our server was attentive and helpful, even though it was only his second day. My only complaint is that it's a very loud restaurant. On a busy Saturday night, it was packed and extremely loud and hard to hear at our own table.",4.0

1090,iT0szo4cyyp5YQMSrGZTdg,"Richmond Auto Wash is a new automated car wash and auto detailing centre that has opened up in the building previously occupied by Sparkle Hand Car Wash (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sparkle-hand-car-wash-richmond).

I was happy to find out that a conventional (i.e. non-touchless) automated car wash was opening in Richmond.  I find that touchless car washes, despite being more gentle on a vehicle (perhaps too gentle), tend to waste water and leave a lot of dirt behind.

Richmond Auto Wash offers automated car washes at three price points, Simple (""Complete Ultrasoft-Touch, Exterior Wash & Dry"") for $10, Regular (""Basic Wash, Triple Foam, Ice Instant Shine"") for $13, and The Works (""Triple Foam, Ice Instant Shine, Tire Shine, Rust Buster"") for $15.  Admittedly, I don't know the actual difference between the features offered.  I had purchased a voucher online for the Simple Wash and chose to upgrade to The Works.  I always go for the premium option when it comes to automated car washes since you can't really expect an automated car wash to get your car absolutely clean if it's dirty - only a hand car wash can do that.

They don't offer an add-on for vacuuming, though they do offer hand car wash/detailing service which includes vacuuming.

There was only one car in front of me when I drove up on a weekday afternoon.  Service was friendly, one of the attendants looked over my car when it came out and told me about their current promotions, and my car came out pretty clean (though the tires were not as shiny as they were when I took it to Shine Auto Wash, http://www.yelp.com/biz/shine-auto-wash-vancouver).  The wash itself felt a little rough, but I didn't notice any damage to my car, so it may have been just me.

It's definitely the best automated car wash in Richmond.",3.0

They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. 

The woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. 

Fortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible.

For dessert we had the lemon parfait, yum.

1110,5-ZCrIJ5l-kkzuodomptNg,"I have frequented this store fairly often since moving to Allston in September and even when I was living in Brookline. The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!

We talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.

I personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.

The prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. 

To address the claim of ""animal cruelty"" and ""unscrupulous breeding,"" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.

I then used the online booking tool that allowed me to book a cab. I received a that said I ordered a cab at 7:37 pm.  I was trying to get to a concert at the Lakewood Amphitheater, which started at 8pm.  I received a text that my cab was NOT dispatched, and placed another ""order,"" via Taxi Magic and was told via text that the cab was dispatched.  After another 20 minutes, I decided to just drive.

I just want to know:  why are cab companies, especially affiliated with Taxi Magic, not available via phone, and why are they not jumping at a cab fare that would be around $35 with tip????",1.0

I was planning on trying a variety of beers but my plans changed.  I was watching the MLB playoffs and the game was close and in the 8th inning.  I was ordered a flight to try a few beers and the guy switched the tv to thursday night football.  I asked him to turn it back and he said no because people wanted to watch football.  I looked around and no one was watching so i asked the few people at the bar and they said they did not care.  I told this to the main bar tender and he would not change it back.  I canceled my beer order and left.  I will not be returning if i am in the area.  There are far too many great bar/food locations to waste your time at this place.,1.0

We ordered a $40 dinner combination (variety of dishes comes with this combo). We had a party of five (2 adults, 3 children), so that was plenty enough. The waitress brought everything but only brought four bowls of rice. I asked if we could get another one, and she said ""no. We only give 4 with this"" and before I could say a single word, she turned around and left. I don't mind paying extra for a bowl of rice, but she rudely said they only gave four and left. I am not joking when I say this, but she did not come to our table to check on us; not a SINGLE time. So my family of five had to split the rice. When it was time to leave, we only left $5---a dollar short from 15% tip. We were so unhappy that the lady neglected our table. As we were walking to our car in the parking lot, the waitress comes out and calls us--saying that we did not tip enough. 

Are you kidding?? I refrained myself from keeping all the tip, but sure.. She did bring the food out to begin with. However, the way she talked to me and my family was very condescending and not worth my money.

only because it is a chain...but I was wrong.
It is a lot of GOOD FOOD at a GREAT PRICE.

FOOD: Large portions of good food.
The pasta is not homemade, but it's not overcooked. 
The one jumbo meatball is soft and delicious,
and the Italian Sausage was finely ground, like Irish Sausage.

Get the ""Chopped Salad"" for only $5...
It's got 1/2 an avocado & proscuitto crumbled like bacon!

ONE PROBLEM:  I ordered the GNOCCHI & SAUSAGE online.
Their system asked if I wanted spaghetti or whole wheat pasta.
I thought, ""serving a side of pasta with gnocchi...OK?""
I chose ""whole wheat pasta.""  I received no gnocchi at all...OOPS.

TAKE-OUT DEAL:  Only $5 doubles your entire meal!

And seriously, no disrespect the Miracle - it's just I was so bummed I couldn't finagle this joint as my destination because one beer there last night just wasn't enough to soak in the joint.

I actually only found out about this place's potential thanks to Yelp - yes, I had passed it many a time to head to Middle East, Manray, Miracle, and other 'M' destinations.... and just thought it was, well, closed down frankly.  thanks to Yelp, I popped in for a quickie, and damn it's one of those times where you just wish the quickie was an all-nighter.

35 beers on the menu - and unless you are into funky local brews, you will recognize about 4 of them.  18 cocktails as well (or so I thought, until a Yelper just pointed out that the list of 18 is just a subset of the huge book of cocktails they offer), which are not my vibe - but given that there were a dozen 'iced and prepped' martini glasses patiently waiting on the bar, I figure this is a highlight of the place (I will need to bring Meredith along once so she can sample those goods....)

and the menu, though I didn't order from it, looked great - as did my bar-neighbors' delivered plates.  So I only give this place 4 stars because I LONG to come back here very very soon for a proper meal, then update my review with a final star thanks to that experience.

1) Invariably, with pretty much any flavor ramen you order, but possibly more with the ""butter ramen,"" there is a 3mm layer of oil that sits right on top of all that fragrant broth. I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.

2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.

3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded.

The dough wasn't even cooked, and I almost gagged! How in the world can someone give their customer an undercooked raw pizza! It's just awful! So naturally we called to let them know about the situation and asked if they could deliver the new pizzas to us, since it was their fault for messing up in the first place! Well long story short, they said they wouldn't because they did not deliver to our address, even though it was literally 10 minutes down the road in the next city over! So my husband decided he would just go grab the new pizzas...Well 30 minutes later my husband comes home with the new pizzas and guess what.....they were undercooked and RAW!!!! At this point I was just fed up, so I called dominos back, and told them they once again sold me undercooked pizzas...so the girl on the phone puts her manager on the phone, and I explained the situation. The manager then tells me she personally made the pizza and if she kept it in the oven any longer it would have burned! I told her well then you need to be re-taught how to make a pan pizza because what they should be doing to avoid it from burning the toppings or being undercooked is putting the dough in alone to cook a bit and then taking it out adding the toppings and putting it back in to cook! Clearly dominos needs to retrain these employees at this location! Anyways point to this story is my husband had to go back a third time for new pizza! While the other pizzas got cold! They didn't even want to credit us for the pizzas but they made sure we brought the other undercooked pizzas back! Like seriously they make me laugh!!!

Our waiter was nice, but not the brightest star in the sky.

All of the food came out pretty much wrong (cheese, no cheese, sides, trimmings) and he definitely missed at least one entree order entirely. At the end of the meal, he brought us our check and informed us that he wasn't smart enough (his words, not mine) to split the check.

I had to get our menus, silverware,and remind them we ordered drinks.

We were there for like two hours. The waitress kept apologizing it's just a crazy night. There were only maybe three tables. We would watch the waitress just stand there.

It was so bad I almost wanted to ask her if she liked her job? 

She looks just miserable. she was very rude and very lazy! 

When I finally just ask somebody else for a side of ranch that person just looked at me like they didn't know English!

Our waitress Olga was ok. Not too outgoing maybe it was the language barrier. But she barely made additional appearances filling my water glass. My entree was ok. The fajitas were very good but we were so disappointed in the carnitas. They were over cooked and so dry and had no taste. For 13.50 they should of been great and that wasn't the case.

I ordered my usual crispy catfish, my wife ordered spicy basil chicken, my son ordered beef stir-fry and we had about 4 appetizers.
I bite into my crispy catfish and realize that the fish is not the freshest and my wife tasted her chicken and realized that the chicken might have been bad or rotten or old or something, either way, the chicken tasted horrible.  We decide to inform the server that the chicken didn't taste fresh, she states ""Well, it's the chicken that we have been serving all day and it's the same chicken in your coconut soup.""  By the way, the chicken in the coconut soup tasted old as well.
Instead of just taking it back, the sever got a bit of an attitude with us.  My understanding of customer service is that when a patron tells you something isn't right with your food you apologize, take the food back and offer another solution.... none of which she did.  The server was more concerned about how much we were going to have to pay for the replacement food than the fact that chicken literally tasted rotten.
To top it all off she charged me and extra .50 for about 1 tablespoon of ginger sauce.  Mind you, this was over $75 of food we ordered.  To be treated poorly for sending food back and being nickel and dimed for ginger sauce is pathetic.

1192,0U4-IvACEzC-fhbuIrH9Lg,"What an awful experience! Will not be returning! I am the ideal patient that has no cavities, teeth work, or problems. My whole appointment was just one awful thing after another. 

1. Upon my arrival I'm told they don't have a hygienist so someone else will be doing my exam. Why would you schedule my appointment on a day there is no hygienist when I need a cleaning? 
2. Assistant spent half an hour taking my x-rays because she couldn't get the machine placement correct. Do you know how uncomfortable it is to hold that contraption in your mouth because someone else isn't getting the camera position correctly.
3. Assistant immediately began polishing my teeth and snagged my lip in the tool. First off, why are you polishing my teeth when my teeth haven't even been cleaned yet? Also, as the person polishing my teeth, why are you not maneuvering my lip away from my teeth so you can polish the front of them without spinning my lip into your tool.
4. The dentist? or whomever Anna Nguyen is, returned to actually clean my teeth, and used the ultrasonic. That's fine, however the assistant was not paying attention and continued to suction my throat rather than the water coming from the tool. She also would look away causing her hand to move to then suction my lip or cheek instead of liquid.
5. Once the cleaning was complete the assistant returned to struggling to polish my teeth and then flossed. At this time she missed both of my back molars but I did not say anything because I plan to just floss them myself and get out of there. 
6. Lastly, I opted in the beginning of the appointment prior to knowing that the experience was going to be less than professional, for varnish to be put onto two teeth. The assistant proceeded to dab the varnish all over all my teeth, getting it onto my lips and piles of the product on  my teeth.  My lips are still sticky 2 hours later. 

 I really wanted to like this place but it seems that it's a bunch of newly graduates or maybe interns working here.  The two who handled my appointment today were not even on their website as part of their ""Team"". Long story short, I will not be returning and I hope that no one else deals with the same.

The Pro's I can say is their front desk seems very knowledgeable, in particular their insurance specialist and the business itself seems very up-to-date with everything being digital.",1.0

Thumbs up for that, but then again every time I get something besides a gyro at a Mediterranean place I always end up wishing I got a gyro. Chicken kabab sandwich was good, just too dry for my taste. The wrap itself is pretty dry; the sauce helps but the feta crumbles from the salad is what I really loved adding.  

On one hand I don't really mind if a place has plasticware instead of silverware, but in this case it was hard to get at the Greek potatoes. Which were 1) not really traditionally done but 2) crispy and delicious.

1195,cPtbZ3qneeW8cbc7vv_CWw,"Nuts and bolts: Attended the 2013 Final Four games here. After 2.5 years of living in Atlanta, it was my first visit.

Pros: Plenty of parking available. Apparently even during a crazy event such as the Final Four.  Pricing will vary.  Convenient to MARTA.  However, lines can be quite long after an event.  Plenty of bathrooms.  Plenty of concession stands. Efficient entry process. Loved that they could do indoor fireworks! Fun. Even the view from the very top isn't that bad.

Cons: Why do the concession people have to take your bottle lids?  Really?  At first, I thought it was cause they wanted the Coke points.  But they do it even for water.  The whole point of me getting a bottle is so that I can reseal it and not have to worry about it spilling.  When I am buying alot of food, it also helps if I can slip the drink in my purse to carry other things.  I do appreciate the one guy that gave me some aluminum foil to put on top.  Super nice gesture.  
Also, some of the concession people could use some training on their items and on being personable.  Ran into a few grumpy ones (but maybe they had a good reason to be grumpy). In the nuts line, I asked for some candied pecans. Got almonds instead.  Not so fun once I realized that later on in the game. I gave them away. Waste of money.

My Significant Other and I came in on a Sunday around 5:45 and had been dying to try this place. As we entered we were asked if we had reservations and I replied we did not. Long pause from the hostess... I finally perked up and said...can we still eat? She said of course and seated us in the quaint dining room which has 3 other tables with guest in it. The service went up from there...and our server was friendly and engaged and offered her personal suggestions and listened intently as she chatted up the other tables as well. We settled on the Shrimp Bruschetta as an appetizer, I odered the scallops and my Significant Other chose the buttermilk fried chicken. 

The Shrimp Bruschetta I was a little disappointed with; one large hunk of bread with some sauce and shrimp left with the tails on did not impress me. It was awkward for two people to eat. I felt like the flavors did not complement each other and I personally do not want to pick through my appetizer to cut the tails off the shrimp. 
 My Significant Other liked his Chicken though I found it to be just okay for their signature dish. My scallops were very good and light with the butternut squash.
I had pondered the dessert menu the from the second I got there and so many things looked so good I could not decide. I went with the Drunken Cherry Bread pudding with Buttermilk ice cream. I am not sure what the Cherry was drunken in...cause I could not taste it. The dessert was light and I would have preferred it a tad sweeter or more tart.

The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) 

Just a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.

My husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.

We ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.

Would I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.",3.0

1234,AfwuXjDl6JVOtpwlvjoCzw,"Back story:
My sister and her husband were married in March in NJ where they reside. Both wanted to come visit over the July 4th weekend and stay at the Crowne Plaza in Danvers and frolic in the Coco Key Water Resort in part because they're  kids at heart and because we assumed that the park would be perfect entertainment for my two kids ages 2 and 7.
Let's start with the room at the Crowne Plaza:
The room was nice enough. It had a king size bed and pull out couch and seemed quite clean.  The wallpaper was peeling a little and the carpet seemed a bit worn but other than the usual wear and tear one expects, it wasn't bad. 
The air conditioner in the room at the Crowne Plaza, was on non-stop for the duration of their stay.  The thermometer reached into the 90's for most of the visit and maybe the high temp contributed BUT the ac worked intermittently for all 3 days of their stay.  Also, there was a weird odor emanating from the ac.  To be blunt, the air coming out of the ac smelled like terrible flatulence.  My sister and her husband didn't complain to the front desk and get a change of room  so I have no idea if this issue was restricted to their room or not.  All I know is that it smelled pretty bad and was not coming from anyone INSIDE of the room.
FYI: The Crowne Plaza DOES NOT have it's own pool or gym. Guests are able to swim at the pool run by the gym who co-shares some of the hotel space.  For $5.00/hr a hotel guest can swim to their hearts delight...
Another FYI: My sister and I had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which she billed to the room. Total cost of breakfast $233.00 and we are still dealing with the billing department to get this resolved...

CoCo Key Water Resort:
Man this place was a let down.  I brought my 2 year old who was just too small to enjoy anything.  The din in the water park is constant and throbbing.  There's a small area all the way on the right of the water park,  that caters to small kids but was over run with bigger kids who couldn't play on the bigger slides but were clearly too big to play in the toddler area. In the toddler section, there are 3 smallish waterslides as well as water fountains and spouts.  
The waterslides are for kids under the height of 48"" and for a small guy like my 2 year old, not doable alone.  For my 7 year old, the kiddie area was boring -lots of toddlers screaming and playing is not fun for a ""big kid"" and is too much for a really little kid.
The middle of the park is comprised of 2 largish waterslides -perfect for a 7 year old- and 3 smaller slides.  When I visited, one of the smaller waterslides was out of commission and the staff weren't doing a great job monitoring the ins and outs of the larger slides. My sister whisked a small child out of the way of one of the bigger slides when a child rocketed out of the slide at the bottom and almost took the child at the bottom out.
Surrounding the middle area of waterslides is a lazy river. The lazy river is only 2.5 feet deep and the tube the rider sits in is pushed by some type of current around the circumference of the middle slide area. The lazy river was pleasant enough when we rode on it the second day but on the first day we were there, they didn't open it due to 3 hours worth of concurrent staff breaks that ran from 10am-1pm.  
The last area of slides -actually just 1 slide- is a huge, 3 story indoor/ outdoor snake of a slide.  This slide looked like fun but my 7 year old was under the required 48"" to ride.  
The other couple parts of the park that bear noting were the 2 small indoor pool areas which are set up with basketball hoops and a sort of obstacle course and the outdoor/indoor adults only spa/hot tub area. These were ok however the hot tub area is not monitored by a lifeguard and though the rules clearly state that the hot tub is NOT to be used by anyone under the age of 18 due to health issues, we saw several kids go in it.
A few more things:  Contrary to what the website boasts, there isn't a pool side bar where drinks get served to an adult while in the pool.  Also, the food is really overpriced and gross -that's for another longer review :)
All in all, I wish we had gone to Canobie Lake or another outdoor water park which would have cost about the same amount.  $40 tickets for anyone over the age of 2, $4.25/swimmy diaper, $8.00 yucky pizza. Two thumbs down.",2.0

The salad served on the day I visited consisted of chickpeas, fennel, red onion, red cabbage and oranges... no filler mixed greens or butter lettuce. Sounds a little odd but it was so good and filling - even my boyfriend enjoyed it! 

The Porchetta Sandwich is also super good! The bread is crunchy on the outside and pillow soft on the inside. The Porchetta itself is cooked to perfection with crispy pork skin and juicy loin meat. I had a similar sandwich in San Francisco which is compatible but Meat & Bread's is slightly better in my opinion. 

Good place to get your meat and bread fix for sure.",5.0
1238,J4YqHoUcSRcG3cJGztbSUA,"Mr. Tires nets a three-star review from me based on two wildly different parts to my experience. First (and most importantly) was the service itself.

I was looking to have four new tires installed on my car and I wanted a specific brand of tire (Dunlop). After researching it online, I discovered that Mr. Tire's price was low enough that it beat ordering tires from Tirerack.com and paying for shipping. As a bonus, Mr. Tire was able to get the tires installed the same day I called them, unlike other local shops that couldn't get them in for 2-3 days. Same day was important with the first big snow storm coming.

The installation went fine. Not unexpectedly, my car also needed an alignment. After having the tires installed and alignment done, I left. A short drive told me there was something ""off"" with alignment so I drove right back. The mechanic at Mr. Tire immediately put my car back on the alignment rack and tightened it up a bit more. I drove away a satisfied customer, other than having to clean the mechanic's greasy hand prints off my steering wheel. So, the service gets four stars.

I will give the shop itself only two stars. There was no Wi-Fi. No cable TV, just local over-the-air TV with poor reception. No water, only terrible coffee to drink. The bathroom was dirty. It wasn't a very pleasant place, like it was built in the 70's and has never been upgraded.",3.0

1242,en6aE9TraEz3K4rEfgbhSA,"They're nice enough here, and they sell some nice looking furniture, but i question the quality.  Years ago I purchased a leather sectional couch here for approx $4,000.  (Perhaps their quality has improved in recent years?).  It lasted about 2 years before i went to sit down and as i did, I heard a loud ""snap"" (i'm not a large or heavy person) and a piece of the frame clearly broke.  The couch cushion in that area immediately started sagging.  Luckily it was under warranty.  I called and the company sent out a rep to examine the couch. He didn't even flip the piece over to feel the obviously broken piece of wood frame poking through the bottom (which i later found to be cheap particle board and not suitable for furniture). He told me it was sagging because i always sat in that same spot and it wore this way over time, which is absolutely not true.  (And even if it was true, a couch is meant to be sat upon and for $4,000, it should last more than a couple of years).  So the 5 year warranty was totally useless.  I got a quote to have it repaired and it was actually cheaper just to buy a new couch.  This may not be Dania's fault, but they should sell better quality furniture for the prices they charge--or stand behind them.  I loved this couch, while it lasted.  Buyer beware.",2.0

The men's room is clean, spacious, and well appointed with couch and fireplace. Aaaaaand, the servers are good at, and seem to enjoy, their jobs, which makes all the difference in the dining experience.

It's so incredibly off putting. Last time she seemed annoyed that we asked about our order (we were waiting almost an hour and just wanted to check in), and then annoyed that we asked if they would mind refilling the hot sauce because both were empty. Now today, at 11:30am on a Sunday, she was deterring us from ordering saying ""it's going to be a long wait, you're better off ordering at Bon vistro"". I said that's ok, we'll wait, and she rolled her eyes and seemed annoyed that I still wanted to order tacos. I was so taken back because I don't ever expect someone to act so annoyed with a customer for no reason and especially don't expect them to deter me from ordering. I'm uncomfortable ordering when I see she's working. Huge bummer for such a good food truck. 5 stars for the food but the 2 stars is to alert the owner this is a huge problem.

Taking a step back: I was originally excited to experience Burnside Brewing after my friend sent me a pic of his pork chop and potatoes he had for dinner. It looked crazy-gourmet which took me by surprise b/c of the business name and he said he was impressed both w/taste and price.
The joint itself is loaded w/personality. There's off-street parking. Dining both inside and out. And the joint was fairly hopping w/a variety of folk from hipster to families. 
Our waitress was very friendly it's just that she was ooooh soooooo sloooooow. 
And I wasn't going to say anything until I tried Smokehouse Tavern about a week later and experienced the same situation. Excellent food, fine establishment but very sub-par service! I sincerely hope this is not a trend.
When I say our waitress was slow that includes our greeting, taking our order and apparently my biggest gripe of producing a check.

The salsa passed our test, but what really made me happy was my entree order:  Chile Relleno en Almendra, Poblano pepper stuffed with sautéed picadillo blended with almonds, raisins, tomatoes and onions, topped with almond cream sauce, served with white
rice and salad. At first, I thought the dish was going to be too sweet... but after a bite or two, ah!  what a perfect blend of flavors!  So very good!  It's opulently rich and delicious.  Boyfriend ordered Enchiladas Alamo and complained there wasn't enough meat in the sauce (this is not an unusual comment -- we should always order extra sauce or extra meat in the sauce).  Our visiting friend, a pork lover,  ordered the Puerco Mestizo, Pork meat sautéed with chile ancho sauce

As much as I like a good bowl of the stuff, I get bored at the idea of soup as my entire meal, particularly for breakfast. Bacon anyone?

We decided to check it out on a chilly and rainy morning a couple weeks ago.

First impressions were fine (clean with the typical no-frills Vietnamese restaurant decor) with the exception of the fact that the restaurant was completely empty. Any pho joint worth its MGS should be filled with its faithful slurping on noodles on a weekend morning. 

Carter ordered the pho, and I, anticipating a big brunch a few hours later, just ordered some spring rolls. A quick visual inspection of the pho, upon arrival at the table, did not inspire confidence. It looked watery, and an empirical test proved the hypothesis. Bleh!

The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.
However, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her ""magic card"", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.

1266,THlYL1nGEW3OS_u3RJtEsA,"Kongee Dinesty has one of the best congee (rice porridge) in town. Their menu is kept simple, which allows them to keep consistent with the quality of their food and service.  I have been back to Kongee Dinesty half a dozen times for brunch and lunch and still have not been disappointed.  I have found their menu somewhat unappealing for dinner items however, hence I never came here for dinner.  

One of my favourites is the build-your-own congee option from their lunch menu (from 11am - 2pm).  You can pick and choose the contents of your congee and side dish to your likely -- very much like the many build-your-own noodle dishes at places like Deer Garden and Cattle Cafe.  

I have referred several friends to Kongee Dinesty and they share in my opinion that this place is worth a visit when you want a taste of your mom's homemade congee in a relaxed setting (with plenty of parking too).",5.0
1267,Dut5MOOoXBUwOn30RAvepw,"I go to Smokey Bones usually during the later hours. It's usually the only place around me that is a bar and also still serve food late at night.

It's pretty hit or miss with this particular one. One time I get awesome service and great food. Other times the service is just okay, and the food is a disappointment. I've had the pulled pork sandwich recently, which was great however the mac & cheese tasted like something made from a box. I had the loaded fries last night, and it tasted as though it had been just sitting out from a while, and the fries itself were either burnt or overcooked.

Same as the food, the service is hit or miss also. Service is a pretty big deal for me. One time I'll have a server who is great, and another time I'll get a server who doesn't seen to be thrilled to be there.  

The place itself is pretty nice. There are TVs around the bar so you can watch your game while you eat. The bar is right in the middle of the restaurant.

On the plus side: The daily drink specials are pretty good. Try the Bones brew, it's pretty good and cheap... $2.50/pint.

A guy finally saunters out very slowly, gives me a form, and says ""45 minutes to an hour."" No other info, and they've just finished the only other car there, so I'm wondering if I heard wrong. I fill out the form including my phone number, ask the guy if it's really going to be 45 minutes, and he goes, ""yeah, maybe slower."" I thought about leaving at that point, but I wanted to get the oil change over with. The office is attached to a coffee shop, and since the other shop on Lamar recommended waiting there, I head in. Wait an hour without hearing anything, go into the office again to check how much longer, and realize my car is already out in the lot. I ask how long it's been ready, and was told it's been a while, but they figured I was in the coffee shop or somewhere else. I asked why they didn't text since they had asked for my phone number, and was told they don't do that. Every question I asked was answered as if I was inconveniencing the guy. I don't usually get pissed that quickly, but the guy just seemed like he could barely be bothered to breathe, much less provide customer service. Normally, shops will tell you what to expect: how they will (or won't) contact you, where your car will be when it's done so you can keep an eye out for it if they don't notify you, and then they'll go over your car's condition and whether anything needs to be replaced soon. None of that from this guy. I got so fed up that I left without my receipt. I wish I'd read the reviews on this place before going.

1277,oNNTEpc2PmB4w_vy9pbsJw,"""A Bit Embarrassed""

I'm not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone's- meal comped last night.

Yes, I'm doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!

Long story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% ""service charge"" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for ""big parties."" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar ""face"" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).

Still, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, ""hey, bad night."" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with ""regulars"" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.

So when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were ""nonplussed"" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the ""automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it."" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to ""chat.""

I have to say . . . I'm ""a little bit embarrassed"" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and ""agreed"" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked ""80 or 90 hours"" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said ""I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.""

Well, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a ""freebie"" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a ""service charge"" and we didn't) and while Emily ""tipped for me"" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . ""Huh?? What just happened??""

Monday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .",3.0

So we wanted to check out a NE diner as we were planning a trip to Boston.  Yelped this spot and thought this place would be a good one to check out.  Big disappointment.

Decor: Pretty cool, real diner feel with decoration from the 80's and the look of a library from the Breakfast Club movie

Service: pretty attentive, but it seemed like the waitresses were fighting over who was serving us at our table.

Food Ordered: French Texas Toast with sunny side eggs, toast, sausage and homefries.  The french toast was not to remarkable, the eggs were okay, the homefries seemed a little under-seasoned but the sausages were good.  The sad thing about the meal was the toast was overly burned to the point that it was not edible.  I couldn't understand how they could serve something like that.  

Overall my experience was okay.  I noticed that there were quite a few regulars in the diner, but all were men, which could be explained by the busty young waitresses.  But my food was just okay.  Again, I think I'd rather go to Denny's.",2.0
1286,hfbNKnzroBH5OoaKt5gHIA,"I'm pretty torn because every time I'm in town I must grab a Cosi squagel but the past couple months they have been sliding in everything. I really like the food here. I always grab a TBM squagel if I'm getting breakfast and for lunch I usually opt for the classic salad which is really filling. The place is in desperate need of a renovation as some of their chair seats are ripping and overall it's a little dirty, they don't maintain it quite so nicely. But really I love the food and they have wifi and there are always tons of places to sit.

Firstly- there are two different staff squads from what I can tell. The weekday morning staff is super on the ball. They are really nice, are great with taking your order and really pay attention to detail when making your salad. They never forget my coffee or orange juice and always bring out the order to me when it's ready even if I'm taking it to go. 

But the weekend morning staff and later in the day staff are pretty awful. They are constantly forgetting my coffee, and when I order multiple squagels to go they somehow get them all mixed up. I really don't understand why the past 4 times I've had to remind them I ordered a coffee. Also, I understand the egg on the squagel doesn't stay put sometimes but the other staff doesn't seem to have a problem making sure the sandwich is stuff, but for whatever reason whenever we get squagels with the weekend morning staff, we get back to the office and everyone is always like- where did the egg disappear to? There are just remnants of egg because they make the sandwich sloppy. Here's the best part, I ordered the basic pizza from them with basil and she tossed parsley on the pizza. We had taken it to go and didn't want to go back. 

It's really hard to figure it out and is quite a toss-up. If you get the right staff you can be super happy with your meal and the wrong staff can just make you sad.",3.0
1287,eVJsMoKUo6mzZp8P4nXtqQ,"Great Italian food!

Had a reservation for dinner with the boyfriend.  When we showed up, Daniela, the hostess and owner, greeted us and let us know that the party at our table was still lingering so while we waited, she offered us each a complimentary glass of  wine.  We weren't in a hurry so not a bad way to start.  After being seated, we scanned the menu and the bf decided we should try the chef's tasting, which I believe was around $70-75 pp.  The server let us know that it takes about 2-2.5 hrs as they time the courses giving the diner about 30 mins per course.  

Pros:
The food was excellent!  I know that visiting a country doesn't not make you an expert on the cuisine, my bf says this is his favorite Italian restaurant in Austin.  (I personally think it's partially because he can practice his Italian with Daniela.)  He and I don't always agree on food (among other things) but we both loved all our dishes.  Service was good and Daniela frequented our table to see how we were doing.  She also recommended a wine for us which was good, moderately priced, and paired well with the dishes.  I appreciated that she didn't just choose the most expensive bottle on the menu (have had several servers do this).

Cons:
The draw back was the portion sizes.  We had the waiter refill the bread basket several time, not because it was amazing, but because we were still hungry.  I understand that in a tasting, the portions are scaled back, but we both left the restaurant that night a bit unsatisfied.

1300,VVfRMqpurzJz5W-pVkjtSg,"When you go to Disney World's parks, you expect Mickey Pretzels, Ice Cream Bars, and Chicken Tenders. What you don't expect, is high end African fusion cuisine in the middle of Animal Kingdom.

I dined here solo and was given the most hospitable experience I believe I've ever encountered at a restaurant. The hostess was kind and seated me without a reservation, my server was nothing less than awesome and told me so many beautiful details about the restaurant I wouldn't have known, and I even sat next to some amazing people who actually worked in the restaurant and were dining on a day off.

I ordered the Lunch Tasting Menu ($49) with a Vanilla Passion Fruit Iced Tea which came with a side of Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup so you can control the sugar level. 

The first course was a trio of a black eyed pea fritter, sous vide octopus, and butternut coconut milk soup with shrimp. Everything was exploding with flavor, and I was sad when it was gone. The octopus was fork tender and the sous vide process was utilized wonderfully.

The main course was from a selection and I chose a vegetarian ramen dish with a mushroom broth, vegetables, and a siracha lime sauce. Spicy, flavorful, large portion. Can't complain about an awesome bowl of ramen!

Finally was my favorite -- the dessert trio. Deconstructed cheesecake, guava mouse, and a ganache with Egyptian sea salt. As a pastry chef, I understand and appreciate the refinement that goes into a well-executed plate of dessert; all 3 of these were spotless on flavor, presentation, and variation of texture.

The sophistication of this meal belongs in a high-end restaurant that can compete in NYC or anywhere easily. 

At the end of the meal, you receive a postcard collectible of an original drawing tributed to the AK. I love this restaurant, I love the food, and I love the service. Do yourself a favor and find some time to escape the jungle of the theme park and enjoy a fantastic meal at Tiffin's.",5.0

1314,PScUKr6fXT1WoEnjTCUK_w,"I'll start off by saying that four stars here is generous. But it is for two simple reasons, the view is absolutely gorgeous and the ambiance is far above that of the Oasis. If you want a sunset dinner or cocktails overlooking the lake, Soleil gets four stars.

Now for the bad news. The food is only three stars. The menu sounds great with trendy options that would compete downtown. Unfortunately, what is delivered to the table falls a little short. I am normally very good at picking out flavors and appreciating unusual combinations, but there is a sweetness to many of the savory dishes that I can't place and just doesn't seem to belong. Sweet caesar salad? Sweetened bell peppers with hangar steak? Even sweet fingerling potatoes. It is not overwhelming by any means but just enough to leave my taste buds confused and off-balance.

I tried the curry a little while ago and came away very impressed. Spicy enough to be interesting, but not annoyingly hot. That's pretty rare, for me. I would very likely get the full plate if doing so did not mean I'd have to skip out on getting a wrap.

The lemonade iced tea is probably my favorite of their drinks. It could stand to have more lemony flavor, but as an iced tea, it's very good. I'm slightly less enamored with the punch they offer -- it's decent enough to buy, but it's missing something. I hesitate to say it should be less sour, because I'm a pretty big fan of sour, but that tends to be the crux of the takeaway.

So, yeah. Still wonderful.",5.0

We offered to leave, but they insisted we stay and even fired up a few things so we could get everything we ordered.

1325,nNQ2RKAQkJ8BOvXn_VH3Pw,"I'm not a food trough kind of person, and prefer quality over quantity.  It seems to me Hometown has kicked the quality up a notch recently, making it an occasional go-to place when I'm in the mood for massive meat product.

There are several items I now like here.  The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. 

Surprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. 

Another surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.

The atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.

Dinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.

I went here with a Groupon and wanted to give this place a try, third place trying Cuban food outside of Miami, I hoped this place wouldn't disappoint me like the others. I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place.

1330,OFt_4oaO6IMkhLo9pyrb7g,"Point #1 - Haggle Free?

Now if you know anything about the East Coast, you know that EVERYTHING gets haggled and negotiated.  I have this down to a science.  I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  

I pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. 

Instead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.

Conclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.


Point #2 - Prices are insane??

Once upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!

Now buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  
I am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.

Kudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  

Now I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  

This was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.

The showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.

Summary

Despite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.

To summarize:
- Service was terrible and incompetent. Server didn't know the menu, very low voice volume and didn't understand english. 
- Food took 4 times longer than before. 
- We were seated prior to 4 other tables that were sat after us and they were served their food long before they took notice that we were aggravated and waiting. 
- Music is now some upbeat hip-hop jazz. Its strange. 
- Noodles were stale and food portions were smaller but only slightly smaller. 
- My friends Pad-thai came with pre-squeezed limes which leads us to believe they are possibly re-using food. 

Overall i wont be returning here. Instead i will be dining at the Bumby location where the original owners now reside. 

Also, my veggies looked old, not re-used per-say but old as in sat out for a while and left to wilt/brown. Again, i will not be taking my friend groups here anymore. Go to Bumby and save yourself the let down.

UPDATE: As we finished our meal the manager came over and asked about the lime and apologized and removed her meal from the bill which was quite generous of him.

My favorite entree is the seared Ahi tuna.  But definitely check out their daily specials.  Sometimes they get in gigantic stone crab claws.

The wine selection is great and they poor stiff drinks.  Always a plus.

Instantly attended to and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  I don't know what probs other reviewers had, but we had none.  

We enjoyed the Proletariat Red, simply delicious and not too hoppy, not too sweet...just riiiiiight.   

I had the chicken ciabatta club sandwich and Mother Mary was it delicious!  Thick salty bacon, freshly grilled & slightly smoky chicken breast, sliced red onion and all the fixings on a warm and chewy ciabatta roll - which was a carb lover's wet dream.   Chose the tomato soup (oh how I wanted those fries but alas, the starchy carbs of the ciabatta roll cancelled those out)....

My compadre enjoyed a Blue Cheese burger or something of that sort.  Had mushrooms and crumbled bleau cheese on his beef.     I know he thoroughly enjoyed it  because he had visible and audible Foodgasms -  moaned and groaned through his entire meal.   He then emailed me later to tell me how fantastic his food was and can we please go back there soon!?

Brunch: my four friends and I were all thrilled with our meals. I had the blueberry pancakes and they were amazing--flavorful and buttery with crispy edges. The bacon and coffee were incredible, too. My only critique (and it's super minor!): the sugar bowl is fully stocked with artificial sweeteners and only 2 sugars. Our table asked for more sugar and was given another bowl with the same setup. Strange ratio. Also, with such high quality coffee, I was surprised not to see liquid sugar on the table. 
Dinner: We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. A sweet and personable waitress took our drink order. But then we had another waitress--who was a tad intense. Our group had pizza and burgers and were all happy with our choices. Our waitress forgot about us after a male friend of hers came in to visit. It was odd--she stood a few feet from us, but was too engrossed in her conversation to notice we were done with our meals. We waited a while before the sweet waitress from earlier came by to wrap up our leftovers and bring us our check. We wished our tip could have gone directly to her and the hostess!",5.0

I can't comment much on the service since I usually get take out, but my orders have been taken care of promptly.

The food here is a step up from your typical pizza joint.  Classic NY choices, especially the pizza, sausage and pepperoni rolls, won't let you down.  The hoagies were decent as well.  People need to get over the whole NY attitude thing.  We're not still fighting the Civil War, are we?  It's a NY pizza place, so what do you expect?  I want an authentic NY experience.

Appetizers were $10-$12 and soups $7 - the soup of the day was tomato basil - I've had much better...seems like it wasn't finished because they left the veggies chunky including the celery.  Buffalo calamari was good but nothing special...frozen calamari with franks hot sauce and a side of blue cheese.  My jerk swordfish tacos were under  flavored on the swordfish itself and covered in sauces.  My kids lobster ravioli ($27) was average.

1369,nNdOEXTo1pHdYKR8Isdyag,"Saturday night on Valentines Day weekend. The call ahead told of new changes that there was no reservations or call ahead seating. Our wait at 7PM was 35min. The bar staff was friendly and accomodating considering that they would rather fill their chairs with dinner and drink checks. We noticed patrons leaving 35 cents for a $10 tab because their table was ready. Please tip all staff accordingly. They are taxed on 15% of their total sales for the evening. We are not big fans of the hi-top tables, but their largest dining area had been converted to these. You could not turn your head without seeing at least 4 TV's in front of you. The music was acceptable, but really neede to be lowered. Good greif, I've grown into the old person that says ""It's to loud"". Many restaurants do not play TV volume, and compensate with their choice in music. Remember when this place had channel selector box's on the table to let you choose what you wanted to hear? She had the Baby back ribs, and I the St. Louis style. They used to come to your table, open a bag for rib bones, explain the sauces, and ask if you were in need of anything extra. This was a drop and run. We opened our own bag and asked another server what the different sauces were. My corn side dish went back right away because it was barely warm. So did my replacement corn. I switched to cole slaw. Next my ribs went back because they were not succulent at all. They were over-smoked to dry. I switched to pulled pork, because I knew it only needed to be plated from a steam table. I wanted to eat with my wife, not watch her while they cooked something else. The mark of a customer service retaurant is one that apolagizes and compensates to make it right. 2 cold sides, and a bad entree resulted in the check being changed to remove the item and add the new. It was dropped on our table with out an offer of dessert. This was all going on while staff huddled nearby dragging together tables, discussing it, and dragging them apart. They did this twice. Trying to decide if it would be too crowded to sit that many people around that small of a table. TWICE. My wife said the bathroom was well used and OK clean, but a staff member was tiding up as she was leaving. We navigated our way out through the loitering staff as well as the patrons.

Fresh fish, good rice, and excellent miso.  The service was good.   Pricing was good.  We ordered three rolls. miso, and edamame for $24.    Also liked they had some rolls out of the ordinary rather than the typical combos that you find at many places.

A few notes having read some other reviews....One review talks about the fish being frozen, he must not know much about sushi fish as all sushi fish is frozen as a way to kill any parasites the fish might have.  

Size,  the place is small.  There are only 7 seats at the sushi bar and one table.  On a Thruseday evening at 7:30 not a problem.   Additional options is you can order sushi at Roscoes bar next door.  Roscoes provides the liquor service for the Miyamoto sushi.  So if the place is full simply sit next door.

I came here with some friends around 6 on a Friday night before heading to MIT to see a play and we were able to be seated right away. The service was decent, again, nothing stellar, but nothing to really complain about. 
We had the ""Hot Platter"" for an appetizer which is really just an assortment of friend things. It was nice to nosh on, but I'll admit I'm not enamored of fried foo, as a rule. 
I had the Moo Shi Vegetable, which was definitely served with ample plum sauce and plenty of pancakes. And while it was tasty, I did find myself wishing I'd ordered it with some meat. In the past I'd had their General Gau's chicken and it's definitely yummy. So, maybe I'll go back to that next time. 

Word of warning: Their spicy noodles (I think it's the dun dun noodles) are veeeeeeeery spicy. So be prepared. Oh, and they're cash only, which is good to know before walking in.

Overall, if I lived closer, I'd definitely order from them more often and if I'm in the area, I may choose this place, but for now, it's gonna stick on the list of ""places that are possibilities"" and will not likely be making a pilgrimage to Central just for this place.",3.0

This was a sunday night concert.

Tickets stated doors open at 6pm, with showtime at 7pm.  Great concert... amazing talents.

The downers:

The doors didn't even open til 7 or 7:10.  I had a ticket with a seat in the balcony, so there was no real need to stand in line.  Dr. John didn't even go on stage til 8:45.  Long boring wait... I guess this is the HOB's way of getting concert goers to by more drinks.

After dr. John, it took about 1/2 hour to rip the stage down and set up for Cyndi Lauper.  The entire concert ended at about 11:45pm... Although I loved both performers and they did an outstanding jobs.... this was way too late for those of us getting up for work on monday morning.  And not knowing that this would be a late night was part of the problem.  I can't imagine what it was like for the people who were standing the entire time.

Another downer:  no much ventilation in the balcony... no fan action... kinda warm too.  Also, my knees were too high... for a new venue, the seating has design issues.

Last downer:  They had two big screens on the 2nd level with camera's on the performers.  The camera angles never changed... just a long shot of the stage... My question was:  why even have them if they are not going to be used for close ups etc etc.  They were basically useless.

All in all -- I liked the HOB when it was in Cambridge.  While the show was amazing, I think the HOB mgmt and processes for running a show need big improvements.  Beware of Sunday night concerts... I'm just sayin!",2.0

Everything was delicious. The Mac and cheese was garnished with ham and greens, which were both seasoned well and added a lot of unique flavors to the pasta. Our waiter was pretty attentive and helpful, which was nice even though it was crowded. If I'm ever in town again, I'd love to check out the regular menu.

After some research and thought, decided to pick a steakhouse and came across Flemings. When I looked at their restaurant week menu, I saw two filet mignon entrees. That did it, and Flemings we went. 

The place was dimly lit inside but spacious and had a warm but cool (not temperature cool...but joe cool cool) atmosphere to it. Everything looked fancy but not too snotty. It was nice. Our waitress was great! She was so professional and polite, very soft spoken but gave out a positive attitude. She was great. However, the servers (they looked like staff that went to all the tables to deliver the entrees) must have been either really busy or confused because they had our entrees mixed up between the four of us on the table. We had to clarify a few times. I guess that was one of the reason I only gave four stars. 

The food itself was good. Our filet mignon was cooked just as we requested and flavorful. Not too salty, not too bland. It was a lot smaller than I thought but it was enough since we got plenty of side dishes. Wine selection was great and my glass went perfect with the entree. Overall, we got a great deal. Originally, the main entree I got was over $40 by itself...but thanks to restaurant week, I got myself that same entree as part of a 3-course meal for under $35. YES.

1419,SMbOctPhgv6f2QARP_y46A,"For my 900th review - Damien S.' review brought this spot onto my radar several months ago, but I'm not from the neighborhood, so I bookmarked it for the future.

The future came, but we were relaxing on Nantasket beach just beyond the Nantasket Beach Resort, a bit over 1/2 a mile away.  Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.

Marvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.

When she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.

For herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll / includes coleslaw.

The portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.

The rest of us shared two ¼ Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll / includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter / includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.

I liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!

We enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.

Though we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.  They were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils.

3.5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.

I realize that the reason for our dislike of the place may not resonate with everyone, but the customer service was just ridiculous. First of all, we stayed in a smoking room, not even by choice but because there was nothing else available. Anyway, we went with it mostly because my boyfriend has his medical marijuana card and figured at least he could smoke in the room with no trouble. At any rate his smoke made the place smell way better than when we walked in. Stale cigarettes and mildew? We wouldn't figure out until we got home, nearly a 5 hour drive south two days later that my credit card was charged an extra $200. When I called I was informed it was a smoking charge. My jaw dropped. I told the man on the phone we stayed in a smoking room, to which he replied with, ""We know what was going on and that's illegal."" I tried explaining the medical card but before I could finish he hung up on me. Yes, he HUNG UP. I've never encountered such poor
customer service in my life. I made at least 5 attempts to call and speak to a manager and never received a clear answer on why or how I could be charged for smoking in a smoking room. When my boyfriend called, he was hung up on as well. To get this problem corrected I ended up calling my credit card company and they had to fight it for me.

This is one of those places that has so much great stuff, and varying menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, that I just couldn't decide on when to come and what to get. I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:

- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)
This is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.

- Sunrise Poutine ($15)
I told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.

- Sunnyside Burger ($15)
As if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.

- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)
Another really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.

It's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious  food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.",5.0

1437,JtKJ3XDIfBV9_p9leirOnQ,"A few years ago Flip Burger 'Boutique' (really, boutique?) was a novel concept. These days, with the vast array of burger spots, Flip Burger is one of several choices. Has Richard Blais the 'creative director', been creative with this concept? Yes. Without a doubt. But this is a burger place and the only thing creative about it is the fact Flip Burger has led you to believe you need to pay exorbitant prices for a 'grass-fed' tiny little burger with 'exotic' toppings like kimchi (which isn't all that exotic) while sitting with tattooed hipsters in white plastic booths which resemble something out of James Bond's Octopussy.

1438,XOgTNl6pJ0P6fjtbhIkWeQ,"We recently moved to this neighborhood and decided to give this place a try. We went here for dinner. The taste was good and I was loving my food. My husband was sick, so he ordered the normal pesarattu instead of the masala pesarattu. After the long wait, he got the pesarattu with the masala. He politely called the waiter and said he had the wrong order. When the waiter went in and asked the lady who prepared the order, she was very RUDE and shouted ""why cant they take out the masala and eat"". We were shocked by the way the lady responded. The poor waiter apologized to us, but the lady did not even care to apologize for her behavior.

Shoutout to the receptionists and shampoo lad--they were super friendly and great.

Cons:
Yvonne had cut my bangs for me before, but this was my first full cut with her. Given her experience, I expected her to have stronger instincts about cutting/what would be flattering for my face and hair type (thick, wavy). Even after a recut a few days later, she just didn't get the whole weight/angles/shape thing right for me.

I also didn't feel very valued or respected. On top of the unflattering cuts, Yvonne didn't even ask my name until the shampoo lad came over to watch, and then, at my recut appointment, I learned that she thought I was unemployed (after we'd talked of my full-time job... twice).",2.0

Their carrot cake is the best I have had since moving to Georgia from Texas a year ago.  We get it every time we come here.  Many folks also say the coconut cake is wonderful.  They usually have 5 or 6 different types each evening.  

The only thing I will say is, don't come here if in a hurry.  This is a very laid back place and they do not bring out the food quickly.  This is a place to sit a while visit with friends or family, and eat and drink like folks do in Europe.  The service is very friendly and attentive while you wait.

For example the Elvish Veggie Burger, Chickpea Fries, and Nachos Supreme. I am a vegetarian, and the veggie burger was so good. Also, the chickpea fries were so awesome, definitely recommend them.

This is definitely one of my favourite spots to game, that is board game! The array of games is quite the feat. My favourite is Apples 2 Apple and Cards Against Humanity , but I am expanding my horizons. I am pretty sure they have most games your looking for!

The constant presence of beggars on the corners really becomes exhausting after awhile.  

There is a smell in the store that at times has made me gag.  And, I have worked in the operating room and ER environment for 11 years.  That is saying something.

I purchased Parmesan cheese, and when I went to actually use it, that same day, I noticed it had expired 3 months ago.  Now, if I was at my grandmother's, who used to keep Cheerios that were so old there were little black bugs in it (sweetie,,,its fiber,,,,No Grandma,,,,those are bugs,,,,well sweetie,,,if you chew it quick and swallow, you won't taste them,,,,and yes,,,she was still talking about the cereal).  Customer Service would not exchange my Parmesan Cheese.  

The selection for a lot of items are limited.  The staff is rarely friendly (although there is an older checker who is always super pleasant).  The check out lines are always ridiculous. The Starbucks inside is heaven for a new psychologist who is anxious to save the world.

1449,ILa6OhudPLRWJgeHMmzgEQ,"Journeyman, I really wanted to like you. I tried so hard, considering the restaurant is literally 6 minutes from my house and thus my neighbor. I love Union Square and the refinement that Journeyman (purportedly) brings is definitely overdue. However... It just does not work. On paper, the restaurant is everything I love: local, modern, inventive, casual, but in reality, the restaurant seems to take itself too seriously. Despite the disappointing dining experience, I'm glad I went, I just won't be returning. 

The hubs and I went to celebrate a wedding anniversary and opted for the five-course omnivore menu, added a serving of the foie gras, confit veal tongue and smoked beef heart. The five-course menu consisted of spring salad with favas, peas, spinach, carrots and had  ""spring foam"", that didn't seem to really serve a purpose; asparagus with soy and bonito; sous vide black cod with leek puree and potato; veal breast with sweetbreads and artichoke and a dessert of cane sugars, including macarons, shoofly pie and about twelve different things. As an amuse, we were offered a warm lentil salad, gruyere gougeres and house-cured ham. There was also a pre-dessert which was a flan with freshly grated nutmeg and post-dessert of poppyseed crackers with rhubarb jam and Florentines with house-made marshmallows. So all in all, we ended up having eleven different things to taste. If I were to order anything again, I'd ask for the cod and the sweetbreads, followed by the flan. Unfortunately, the rest just seemed discordant; the flavors weren't in harmony for me at all. Especially the asparagus dish was so bland, which was so surprising considering there were about 15 components on the plate! Each plate was pretty but the gels, foams and pearls can only get you so far when the flavors aren't up to 
par. 

The drinks were wonderful, albeit tiny. For a $14 cocktail, I'd like more than 4oz. 

The atmosphere was awkward to say the least. We did arrive on the early side, with a six o'clock reservation, but we immediately felt like intruders. There is no music, which automatically made us feel like we should whisper to each other. Space is so spare that some music would definitely compliment the industrial, even slightly clinical vibe. I just wanted the restaurant to feel fun and it is about much as fun as a hospital recovery room. 

The service was... adorable. In the way that there is so much good-willed effort and so little actual success. I seriously thought that our server might explode with awkwardness. The stilted service made me giggly, which in turn seemed to worsen the awkwardness. Ah well. 
All in all, our tab came to $270, which is kind of absurd, despite the fact that we had quite a few drinks - for half that, we could have had a much more substantial and meal at e.g. Island Creek Oyster bar, or Coppa. Not to mention we could have had a laugh.",2.0

1452,IgAEdge6Qwiz_YLBWWN4uA,"The $5 Wednesday night pho special (7pm to 9pm, ignore their website's promise of 6pm) is obviously the main draw for me. I usually get the #17 or #20, depending on whether I want just steak or some brisket also. 5 minutes after ordering an immense tureen of tasty pho is deposited in front of me and I go to town. 15 minutes after that I'm a beached whale, a stranded walrus, a dog who got into a full bag of kibble. It's great stuff, and while I can't claim it's the best I've ever had in my whole entire life, it's certainly worthy of being considered for all their awards they brag about.

I'm always disappointed when Vietnamese places don't do banh mi, and so despite the vast menu, much of which is quite good, I'll hold a grudge. But that pho is definitely worth coming for, maybe even worth paying full price for if it happens to be the 95% of the week that isn't 2 hours on a Wednesday night. Their lunch specials are also worth a look. They're either $7.25 or $7.50 and include scads of shrimp/beef/pork/chicken dishes with white/fried rice, soup, and an egg roll.

Salmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.

Black cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.

Sushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.

Assorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.

1471,GFKuVeckKnWVnSOkIAJ9eg,"I had booked a reservation through kayak weeks in advance of my flight down here in Orlando. I decided to give sixt a try after reading their reviews. I decided to go with their PCAR category at the time seeing how it was even cheaper than their economic cars (6 days totaling ~$193). 

It took us bit of walking to find the correct van stall spot in the airport as it seems like there are multiple places they can park, I found our van parked at A12 since it was lateish at the time ~10pm the van was empty. The front office is very new and modern given that they just opened a few years ago here.

Unfortunately upon arrival they did run out the car in the category and had to give us a Scion FRS instead, not a deal breaker but mildly disappointed didn't get to try out an Audi or BMW. Also I thought the car could have been better maintained. Seemed like the alignment were off while we were driving it as it did make some cranking noise during braking and turning for a 7700+ miles car, the previous drivers most likely drove it really hard to let the car condition deteriorate. The representative was semi-hard selling on the additional insurance and fueling options but after a couple firm 'No' he did let it go. 

Also before I left the trip I had signed up for their Express checkout by pre-filling the required information online. I thought it would be like Avis/Hertz or Dollar rental members where the key and rental information would already be in the car upon arrival. Unfortunately I still had to go through a check-in process which I thought was again a bit of misleading or at least miscommunication to me

Another person mentioned the free bottled water and we helped ourselves to couple bottles as well. There's a small fridge to the corner with free coffee on top of the counter.

My trip had a different drop off point in Tampa, during return it was pretty straightforward and painless the van came and picked us up within a minute after getting off the car in a heavy thunderstorm. Glad they had covering in their locations since Florida thunderstorms are so unpredictable.

Overall its a decent experience, given that it was already late during our arrival we didn't have to wait too long. Reasonable prices and if they could improve on their inventory to match the reservation more closely I would definitely recommend it but from my experience the German rental company Sixt doesn't seem to be much different than your average budget car rental company",3.0

I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.

The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.

The only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.

The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater.

1481,R4tY5KyjfacQKo6wBHv8HA,"It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together.  Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.

We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had ""decided what we wanted"".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.

We hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  

However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding ""clank"" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.

We left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.",2.0

The next weekend i went with my Maid of Honor to get our hair blown out at Back Bay before going to try on bridesmaid dresses. We walked in there was no one at the front desk and we waited for about 5 minutes until  the lady at the front desk came up to check us in (mind you she was in sweatpants and a hoodie-NOT professional). We got to our appointment 10 minutes early for our 10:45 apt. We were given our tea and coffee-no complaints there but not offered wine or champagne which I thought was customary. Come 10:55 we're still sitting waiting for our stylists. I go up to the front desk to ask when we're going to be seen and she was so disorganized. She didn't know who my stylist was. She said something along the lines of ""well the stylist up there will be done in about 5 minutes and the girl who is doing your friend just got here so she'll be up shortly"". We had to be somewhere at 11:30 mind you (I know we were cutting it close but we were seen 15-20 minutes late). I get taken downstairs to get my hair washed first. She didn't offer to take my coat or anything so I had my purse and parka piled on top of me while I hold my hot tea as she is washing my hair. I go upstairs to the station and the lady at the front desk asked my stylist to move over pretty rudely so my friend could sit next to me. We move 3 seats down and then 3 other girls take the seats next to me and my friend ends up sitting upstairs. We were happy with our hair and go down to pay and give our tips. I found my lady and handed it to her but my friends stylist was MIA. We asked the front desk lady if she could go grab her. 2 minutes later a lady comes upstairs asking if we were looking for her (it wasn't the correct stylist). The frontdesk lady STILL didn't know who did my friends hair so instead my friend walked up and downstairs to find her stylist.

My friend and I were trying to go to Esparaza up the street, but they were closed on Sunday, so we meandered down the block to Fonda Rosa.  

Although we were seated quickly, the service was incredibly slow all night.  Sometimes I like to have a leisurely dinner, so this isn't always a bad thing...but this was ""leisurely"" to the max.  

The food was very good.  I got carnitas (the waiter recommended them) and my friend got pollo enchiladas.  The homemade chips and salsa were (which had to be ordered separately) were gobbled up in no time.

Fonda Rosa is a bit pricey.  The place presents itself as a casual dining experience, but the margarita I bought was $10 and some of the entrees were over $20 (not all, some).

Went with a group of four so got a good selection to sample, all pretty lackluster in some way or another. The general issue of this place claiming to be ""Tex Mex"" allows them to get away with replacing traditional ingredients with their Americanized cousins, which doesn't necessarily equal good nor healthy in today's world. My fish tacos were seated among oversized tortillas so I felt like I was eating mouthfuls of bread with nothing else until midway down. Also why not corn for fish tacos instead of flour tortillas? 
Eh.
Waitress was a lil bit bitchy, that's ok, we liked her anyway.
The beans and rice that came with my tacos was nizzasty. The rice was hard and overcooked like I got what stuck to the sides of the rice cooker rather than them turning the rice regularly. The beans were dry too, not fun. 
Eh.
Some weird TexMex spring rolls. If I promise to remember the Alamo can I forget about these? 
Eh.
Some super crazy nachos that didn't have enough toppings for the chips. It doesn't cost that much more and leaves your customers with a good impression if they don't feel like they overpaid.

My friend and I decided to go to Burtons to catch up and enjoy a nice dinner out.  When I politely asked how long a wait is for a party of two, the host (who wouldn't look me in the eye and was more concerned with looking at a couple in the bar) quoted the wait between 45 and 60 minutes.  No big deal for a Saturday night, right?  An hour and forty five minutes (that's 105 minutes for the mathematically challenged) and we were seated.  What's worse is the host had my cell phone number as a point of-reference - no phone call to say they were running late.  No manager to apologize, either.  Instead, the Harry Potter look-alike host, had the audacity to call my cell phone as we were standing in front of the host stand waiting for a table, glaring at him, while there was only one another party waiting for a table, too.

The food was okay - I had the bronzed salmon special that was just, ""okay.""  Dessert, the chocolate torte, was just ""okay"" but still a sweet treat.

Overall ... very turned off by the substandard service.  The restaurant experience begins and ends with the host; welcoming guests as they arrive and wishing them a good night and hopes they'll return as they leave.

Hopdoddy was created to express the perfect union of burgers and beer: Handcrafted Beer (Hop) + (Doddy), the nickname was given to the native cow in Aberdeen, Scotland.

And there you have it, simple and sweet, but make no mistake this place is not so simple but yet the employee's are sweet and very hard working. Everyone from the greeter standing outside in the rain (yes it started to sprinkle) making sure everyone had a menu and answered any questions that were asked. She even handed out some umbrella to customers who were in line but forgot to bring one!

Yes, on some days (mostly weekends) you will be standing in some form of a line to get in and then to order. They only let in so many people at a time as this place is a seat yourself  burger bar. 

Because ACL was in town and the last day of the festival was cancelled due to rain, everyone invaded the SoCo area looking for things to do! We honestly waited in line for about an hour. It is crazy but we were bound and intent to eat here. Our greeter told us what to do once we entered the restaurant as she let us and a few of the other people who were in line in. 

As we were standing in line waiting to place our order, I decided to order a drink from the bar, I cannot remember the name, but it had bourbon and some other stuff in it. The bartender was friendly and made my drink strong. First couple of sips it was good but while we were waiting in line I started to itch and break out in small rashes on my arms and neck. I was super embarrassed walking back to the bar to ask for a refund. Both the bartender and the manager were concerned and offered to make me another drink. Not wanting to piss my body off anymore than it already was I just asked for a refund. The manager said not to worry that it is okay as I told her I have never returned a drink in life.

One of the servers came up to us after I got back in line and asked how many in our group, Minh said two and we were handed our table number. Was told after we placed our order that we could find our table to the right side of the restaurant.

We finally made it up to the counter to order, with all that was going on, I completely forgot what I wanted to order hoping Minh would take his sweet time ordering his meal I scanned the menu and found what sounded good to me.

-Magic Shroom Burger with a gluten free bun, Angus Beef, Texas Goat Cheese, Field Mushrooms, Mayo & Basil Pesto.

-Shared some fries y Chile con Queso.

We got our drink, grabbed some utensils, and found our table. Our waiter brought our food out to us and asked if he could get us anything else (Ketchup, Mustard ect) he even came around and refilled our drink a couple of times! 

My shroom burger was cooked medium well and was full of juicy meaty goodness! The gluten free bun was light and airy and had taste not some stale cardboard excuse for a healthy bun.
This burger was huge (it is true, everything is BIGGER in Texas) I found myself having to half my burger which fell a part in the process of cutting so I could eat it.
One bite and I was hooked like a fish, the texture of the goat cheese and the mushrooms were the best part! 

The fries and queso were good so good in fact that I totally forgot that I am not really suppose to have any type of queso at all. Sadly, I was somewhat sick back at the hotel for a little bit. However, it was so worth it! Creamy queso with a kick of spice paired with grease free fries seasoned to a prefect crisp. It is everything you ever dreamed of in fries and cheese land!

It was a perfect burger for a prefect cooler, rainy day in SoCO!  A bonus point was that they loved my fries and queso photo on instagram! I really like when companies interact with their customers!

1496,JFcC2pTWa9-ct4QmhU4xqA,"I live in the Rollingwood/Westlake area and have been hauling my clothes to Tip Top Dry Cleaners at 12th/Lamar for about 8 years. They consistently did an outstanding job (dry cleaning on premise vs factory). 

Two years ago Tip Top was purchased by Reid's Cleaners and initially they kept track with Tip Top on quality so I moved to a location near my home on Bee Caves Rd.

Quality of workmanship has become all too predictable. Laundered shirts with puckered collars and seams; dry cleaned items with easy to remove spots still visible; loss of structure in dry cleaned items, etc. etc.

What prompted this review was my pick up two weeks ago of a wool Roxy coat (never dry cleaned, worn twice) that ruined the fabric and a Nordstrom purchased jacket/blazer that had the lining trailing behind it under the bag. The (very nice!) ladies in the Rollingwood store helped me remove the liner of the Nordstrom jacket with scissors. Aargh!

When I looked at the other Roxy plum coat it was as if someone had rolled it around in lint and dog hair. It was utterly ruined. It was a gift for my daughter which weeks before had tags on it and had **never** been dry cleaned.  

The poor, great guy at the Reid's location on Bee Caves Rd was very kind and said I would be called, and another woman helpfully told me I would *not* be charged for the DO-OVER on the ruined coat but was for the original destruction, which I had already paid. Nice.

We had a reservation for 5 people at 9:30pm and were seated at 10. 30 mins late... and the bar was SO crowded that we felt like we were in the way the whole time we waited... No comped drink for the wait. Thank god we had a reservation b/c they were telling people it was a 2.5 hour wait when we showed up! Be forewarned, make a resi. The bar is giant, which is nice for the South End. It was packed, like NYC packed. 

We sat, and the tables are nice--not too close to each other, not too cramped. I'd say the majority of people were in their 30s, it wasn't a young crowd which was nice. It was a lively crowd. And it was nice to see a restaurant that wasn't all old white people sitting around with their chardonnay. This was a cool group.

We had 2 waiters, we ordered water and they confirmed that we'd been to a tapas restaurant before. They came back with water and we ordered sangria for the table.

Then we ordered food. Here's what we got:
Shishito peppers-standard, pretty good.
Gambas al ajillo / Shrimp with garlic-shrimp was slightly overcooked, but the garlic sauce was delicious
Truffle salad--one of the highlights of the dishes for me. Really good, slivers of black truffle, sweet apple, a whipped cream that I thought might have been whipped fromage blanc or something super mild, but it was really cream! It was surprisingly delicious.
Whipped sheep's cheese--good, but not memorable
Chorizo with Fig--I didn't have this, but the table LOVED it
Brussels sprouts--this was another highlight of the night for me, really delicious with a great spice--maybe harissa? So yummy and crispy. The top thing in my opinion.
Short ribs--I didn't have any and didn't notice anyone talking about them
Mushrooms and herbed goat cheese--this was really good--nice vinegary kick.
Paella--we got 1 serving of the seafood and 1 of the meat version. I liked the seafood version, but I think people preferred the meat version. The clams were slightly overcooked, but the crawfish was delicious, the rice was well done and had a bit of char in some places that was good.

For 5 people, we had some leftover paella, but probably could have used another dish. 

The main issue was the service--we had 4 plates of food (and finished them) before our sangria arrived. I had to ask the guy filling the water glasses to go check on it for me. (We had the flora version of sangria--it was good, but not the best sangria I've ever had). Someone at the table ordered a coke and it literally came with the paella, which was the last thing to arrive. COME ON. That's ridiculous. They did give us churros to go at the end of the night, but we were all going in different directions, so it was kind of a lost gesture since they were packaged together.

The waiter was loud which was nice is such a loud restaurant, he was nice. But I wish he'd checked on us between taking our order and things arriving. He also implied that we ordered too much for 5 people, when really, we probably could have ordered more and been happy.

When I go again, I'll get that salad, the brussels sprouts, and the mushrooms, and then change it up and try new things. I'll also definitely make a reservation for the early side, and then call to see if it's looking like it will be later than planned.

The service was satisfactory but as a frequent corporate renter the experience was not great. They aren't as polished or knowledgeable ad the larger Biston branches. Some things to keep in mind if you do rent follow. Know your corporate policy. They don't rent to business often and will try to up sell you on insurance (or scare you into it which I found unprofessional), they also put a very large hold on my corporate card, I've never experienced that in 10 years of rentals. 

Be on the look out for damage. The cars are filthy on the outside. This is mystifying as a car wash is down the street. Make the representative confirm no damage for each questionable area. I agree, dirty cars give the impression that they are hiding damage.

First, the good:
1. Love their special lunch menu - salad or appetizer, choice of a few entrees or sandwiches, and then choose between a few different desserts for under $20. Always good. Never a bad lunch there.
2. Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.
3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.
4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.
5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.
6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.

Now, the meh:
1. In the winter, when you can't sit outside, it's a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.
2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great
3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, ""I have to go there again soon!""
4. It is pricey. That seems to be the way of it with good Italian in Boulder. They are not worse or better than anywhere else.

The green onion pie was nicely done and not nearly as greasy as the one at Coco's and was served with a little bowl of spicy roasted red pepper in oil - to which I promptly added soy sauce. 

The noodle soup came piping hot with fresh handmade noodles (quite good) and some bok choy. The soup was light but bordered on slightly bland. I did dump in some cilantro, sliced red onions and green onions that came on a dish. That helped the flavor a bit. However, I think the intent was for the slow-roasted pork shank (served on a separate plate) to provide the flavor, which it did nicely with hints if anise and other spices. Though quite tasty, I wished that there was more meat to complement the tendons and skin. 

I think the next time I return, I'd like to try the spicy beef noodle soup which is a staple of any Taiwanese restaurant - and maybe some potstickers or the beef honeycomb.",3.0

1565,ug8BSVAg7hImVREL_bTjJw,"I go to a lot of Japanese restaurants, and Samurai has consistently been my #1 for almost 2 years and counting! If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai.

The food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime!

The service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before.

I would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.",5.0

The second time I asked about having my skin steam cleaned again, I told her how well my skin responded to it, and the girl said she would.  She did it for about 30 seconds and then asked me if I wanted a vitamin C mask saying it would really help clear up my skin.  Well of course I want anything that will clear up my skin.  So I said yes, and she was like ok that's another $15 and again told me how great my skin would look.  I said ok.  
That was about a month ago.  My skin has never looked worse.  The mask she used caused my skin to get dry, bumpy, and blotchy.  I have asked other people about using a Vitamin C mask and they say its not at all a healthy thing to do to your skin.  My skin is stil blotchy and looks horrible and is not smooth or soft at all.  This was the opposite of what you want after a facial.  I feel like my skin will never feel as good as it did after the first facial. 
I didn't appreciate that she didn't warn me about the side effects of the mask and just tried to upsell me.  I am giving two stars only because the first facial I had was really good.  I will not be returning here and hopefully one day my skin will return to being non-splotchy and smooth.",2.0

It's small with a cozy atmosphere in the winter and open and airy in nice weather. Their cocktails are great, they make them with heart and they are a buck or two cheaper than Woodsman, Tannery or Tabor Tavern. 

The bartenders are very, very sociable and nice - and they love talking about cocktails! This is a big plus in Portland where many with a bar like this are too snooty to chat. Even when it's slammed they are still friendly.

1575,jW527_jH5FuBMcLXgqX-Bw,"I've been going off again and on again to Pro X for almost a year now. I was originally going to the Boylston St location but switched to the High St location for convenience. Therapists at this location are incredibly knowledgeable. The staff here consists of mostly male therapists, except for my therapist Lisa (And Kelsey? Who might only be there part time not sure). I actually prefer a more male dominant clinic, as I find that the atmosphere can be more relaxed while still keeping a professional tone.

I work as a professional ballroom dancer and came in for two injuries (knee and shoulder). Lisa has given me a program geared very specifically to my athletic ability. The skill sets and quality of physical therapists can range greatly. I've been to clinics where I've felt that I was not being challenged enough given the physical demands of my sport. Lisa has designed a program to optimize muscle rehabilitation with a concentration on exercises geared specifically to increase blood flow and nutrients to my knee and shoulder. 

Aside from being a great therapist, I find that Lisa is able to give a genuine warmth and sense of concern for her patients.  While I've been to a number of very qualified male therapists, I find that they can sometimes lose their sense of human connection to the patient and I end up feeling like a cow in a factory line. 

In Lisa I see a great ability to empathize with patients, often putting their needs before her own. No matter how busy she is, or how early or late the day she always greets me with a genuine smile and a welcoming tone. 

Although I find all the exercise technicians to be competent, I have found Kyle to be the most knowledgeable and personable. He, like Lisa has a genuine care and interests in the well being of patients and is always very confident in his delivery of information on exercises. 

Eric acts as a mentor at the clinic, and has really been able to hone in on microscopic details in my rehabilitation that has helped to propel my recovery process. 

Jess, the clinic manger runs the best clinic I have ever been to. The office, while small is neatly kept, towels are always new, rug always clean, and table always sanitized. He has an incredibly staff that demonstrates customer services at its finest.",5.0

Number one problem is the inside.  Run down, dirty carpets, a young girl sweeping right next to me as I ate.  Number two, and probably the biggest reason to avoid is the clientele.  The absolute dregs of humanity.  If the guy talking very loudly in his phone didn't bother you, you could have picked from the idiot playing Pokémon as he went around the buffet.

I'm going to try to be (for me) brief.  

Food & drink:  Very meh.  Interesting, in a ""what?"" kind of way.  But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.  My beverage was a Matcha Latte (had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that ""interesting"" a drink it should have been more interesting.  Maybe it was the day we ordered.

Hmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :O

Service...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.

The building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.  The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe (not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!).  The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at.

The set up is a little different than I was expecting their register is sort of half way in the back almost behind a curtain. I paid about $30 for everything. The crab Rangoon wasn't what I was expecting, it seemed like there was some kind of fish with egg. I've had crab Rangoon from Thai places before and it was still with cream cheese I'm thinking maybe they misheard me or I ordered the wrong thing ok no big deal.

The pork buns pork belly was very thin and that was disappointing compared to the photo on the menu. Imagine the width and length of a pinky finger. Yup.

It's readily apparent that the owner, Celine, treats her Catering Customers very well, and gives them preferential treatment.

However, if you're a Walk-in Customer, then it's also very evident that Celine gives you very short shrift.

That's right, even though her electric door chime automatically signals your entry, she still takes a few minutes to come and wait on you even when you're her only Customer.

The reason for this tardiness is that she busies herself fulfilling her Catering Customers' orders first.

And then, just when you think your order will soon be at hand, she adds insult to injury by taking several minutes more than necessary to finally hand you your order. Please understand that I'm talking about a very simple, 1-item order which would have normally taken only a couple of minutes to prepare.

Indeed, what should have been a quick in/out experience ends up lasting 10-15 minutes. And, when you're the only customer in her store, you're acutely aware that you just don't rate.

To make matters worse, when you ask Celine to put a little extra mayonnaise on your sandwich, she instead hands you a small To Go container of mayonnaise so that you have to inconveniently add it yourself. I don't know whether to call these transgressions poor business practices, or just plain rudeness.

Lest you think I'm being too harsh on Celine, this same sad event has happened to me twice only weeks apart.

Below is a list of my individual star ratings by category. The mathematical average if all categories were evenly weighted is ~2.3.

However, I strongly feel that Celine's rude Customer Disservice is so beyond the pale that only 1 star is what she so richly deserves.

My girlfriend and I went here for lunch and had oysters, shrimp cocktail, and drinks. The oysters were fresh, the shrimp cocktail was nice and used large shrimp, and my drink, a Hemingway Daiquiri, had an interesting taste with a lot of tartness.

I feel that for a place that's called an oyster bar, the selection was surprisingly small - they only had 6 types of oysters to choose from the day we went.

Pricing wise, the oyster prices were in the general range of what I expect from restaurants ($2.75 - 3.25 per oyster). The other seafood items, though, like cocktail shrimp ($12 for 4 large-ish shrimp) were a little higher than I expected.

The service was courteous and generally attentive, but also rather aloof.

I learned about this place from my fellow Yelpers, and you did not disappoint.  

I had the California BLT (BLT + Avocado) and a side salad - When my sandwich arrived, it looked a little smaller than I thought it was going to be, but that's just because I had no idea what kind of amazingness awaited me.  

The bread is so fresh, it slaps you in the face.  

The bacon was perfectly cooked, the avocado was incredibly fresh, and all the flavors sang in harmony as they entered my stomach.  So much so, that I almost couldn't eat the second half of my sandwich.  (Shudder)

The salad was also delicious - is the dressing homemade?  I'll be impressed if that came out of a bottle, because it was damn good too.

My only complaint, and this is a personal issue, is the birds outside.  I have to remember to enter through the side door because I am not a fan of the crows/black birds/grackles that nest in the restaurant's sign above the door - kind of makes me think I'm going to get a nice surprise on my shoulder or attacked everytime I walk past them.

I had made a reservation, but it apparently disappeared and I had to wait with all the plebes.  I was seated relatively quickly after, and servers were pleasant.  I went with the Veggie platter and a salad.  Adding the salad was a mistake.  They brought the salad first,  which ended up delaying the main veggie platter especially long.  They even brought the check in between!  I probably had about 50 calories to start, so was a little annoyed.

The veggie platter itself was very good, and different from your usual Ethiopian fare.  I found it a little spicier than usual, which was a plus.  They have some additional cold dishes including beets, which were a strong point.

Their injera is very pleasing to the Ethiopian neophyte, since it is soft and spongey and cut with wheat, so with less teff = less sourness.  That said, the gluten content goes up.

Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance, which was large, hipster, and fun.  They're very busy with good reason, the food is delicious an affordably priced.  I pigged out and still my check was maybe $20.

I've always wanted to try authentic okonomiyaki and takoyaki and although I'm not sure how close it is to the real thing, my experience here was unique and I found it worth the visit. 

The okonomiyaki was described as a cheesy savory seafood pancake and it was exactly that. It had a nice crisp on the outside and an incredibly soft and fluffy inside. The cheesy pockets were the best! It was more salty than I imagined and the sauce on top lacked the sweetness that I originally thought it would have. The pickled ginger was also unsweetened. It wasn't an unpleasant surprise though. The seafood gave it a nice variation of texture as well. I would highly recommend it! 

The omu curry rice with the pork katsu was also very delicious. The katsu was the crispiest I've ever had and the curry was very homely. The omurice had a comforting light texture to it as well and everything tasted amazing when it was all put together! 

I also had the takoyaki and I'm happy to report that it tasted identical to the ones you can find all over Vancouver from the night market to random sushi places. 

All in all, it was a neat little place to visit at least once. The staff are extremely friendly and they have the most adorable voices!

1656,dSNmJq8nOTds8CYGfxmdYw,"I've pasted the review I posted to the Facebook page for the franchise and on the Wendy's corporate page.

EDIT - FEB 1, 2018 - It happened again.  I ordered three junior hamburgers (NOT cheeseburgers) and a large fries at the drive-thru.  The order-taker repeated my order for accuracy.  I get up to the window, get my order, and discover the fries are rather overcooked.  I was given replacement fries, but was made to wait until two other customers had received their fries & sandwiches.  The replacement fries were on the edge of being overcooked.  Then, upon arriving back home, I discovered I had received cheeseburgers.  AGAIN.  FOR THE 4TH TIME THIS MONTH.  Each time I ordered hamburgers.  Each time I received cheeseburgers.  How hard is it to tell the difference?  I hope the franchise manager is reading this - I've written a complaint to Wendy's corporate too.

This was just going to be about the fries.  Then, I got home, and saw my burgers.

I ordered four junior hamburgers, ketchup/mustard only on each of them.  I saw my order accurately listed on the display by the drive-thru menu.  I get home to discover I have four cheeseburgers.  For me, that's not good - I've never cared for the cheese @ Wendy's, just a personal preference.  The cheeseburger thing has happened twice now.

The fries - for the 5th visit in a row, the fries were near inedible.  I'm not sure if they're always overcooked, just sitting around too long, or a combination of the two.  It seems I can't get fresh fries unless I visit during the peak of lunch rush.

All of that is a shame - Wendy's is my preferred fast food burger chain, and this is the location closest to my house.  But if my orders keep getting screwed up, why should I come back?",1.0

1659,chSZFXJeSchAdKSejfPrLQ,"Born and raised in the Morgan City area, I've worked and ran famous Kitchens around New Orleans and parts South. I was displaced from Katrina and presently involved in the restaurant scene in restaurant row of Orlando. 

1st a review should not be based off of one visit with that said: I've been several times, at first look at the menu in the app section you will see the signs that there is a true Cajun inside the kitchen and behind this menu. Shrimp Boulettes and Crawfish Pistoulletts, What a great treasure to find these 2 outside South Louisiana. The Boulettes are served with a Cajun Mustard and Oil Based Real Cajun Red Rémoulade, without catchup with just the right touch of spice. The Pisolletee: OK! Who doesn't love fried bread stuffed with cheese and a nicely season Crawfish Ettouffe. It just melts in you mouth. On my 3rd visit I indulge into a very nice serving of Blue Crab meat in some creamy well flavored cheesy dip which came with a large helping of homemade chips enough for 3-4 people. 
Po-Boys is a Po-Boy is a Po-Boy. I didn't get one but the people with me did. It is nice to see that Belle Isle is sticking to tradition and severing theirs with cabbage and homemade Rémoulade, I did managed to sneak a bite of my friends shrimp and my wives debris Po-Boys. I'm not a fan of bread that been toasted on what appears to have been the flattop but the Blacken Shrimp was season well was not overpowering. The Roast Beef Debris came out sloppy and my wife needed several napkins to finish it. 
 
If your ever in doubt if your eating true Cajun Food ( Flavor ) not mainstream over spiced food. The first place to look is at the Gumbo. I've eaten the Gumbo on ever visit.. Let me tell you there is a ton of love in this one, whoever is making this Gumbo has the true understating of this dish. Most cooks/chefs have a misunderstanding of this dish and make it to spicy hot or with a strong taste of Roux. This is BEST GUMBO I've ever eaten. Shhh!!!! Don't tell my Mom or that Chef I once worked for with the E in his name...... Not many people can get the sweet flavor out of Okra and marry it with the trinity with just a hint of Roux without the Roux over powering all the goodness in the bowl.......This is a Do NOT MISS DISH!!!!!! 
By the way Gumbo translates into Okra. 
 On my most recent visit I had Redfish Etouffe the Redfish was blacken well and smothered in the very well season Crawfish Etouffee and served with rice and garlic bread. The Crawfish used are Louisiana crawfish and the flavor coming out of these little suckers is amazing. If they were using Chinese Crawfish or Shrimp they would be rubbery and very bland due to the chemicals that are used to preserve them to ship to the US.
The one Sandwich I did eat was a Muffaletta...All I can say its well stacked, lots of meats, cheeses, and top with a lot olive salad. Just wish I didn't have the meats grilled......
The Desserts; The bread pudding is very delicious, ask for it to be warmed up. And for Belle Isle Bayou twist on Banana Foster...It's to die for. Banana Foster Pie.. Oreo Cookie crust, banana foster filling and banana rum pudding topped with banana rum sauce........

The atmosphere is very inviting you will think your walking or sitting outside in New Orleans. Very nice mood lighting. 
 Service is okay appears to be several high school local kids with their 1st job.
Price point is fair.. Need to remember they are using Louisiana Seafood not the cheap Chinese stuff that have invaded the US. 

PS: Geaux for the Lunch Special Mon-Fri: If your looking to have a small taste of Gumbo (Cup), Po-Boy (1/2 half) or Muffaletta (1/4th)",3.0
1660,LzDo-aIAR58FtyMTklP2Cg,"The Enormous Room is one of those places everyone should try because it's different than any other bar in Boston. What the Enormous Room does offer is something rare, but something people who are familiar with Chicago's nightlife can appreciate. 

It's a lounge with a good DJ. It provides a semi-upscale, hip atmosphere for drinking, hanging out with friends and even dancing, but be sure to arrive early because the interior space resembles what would happen if a Miami nightclub and a hooka bar had a bastard child and to say seating is limited, is a gross understatement. 

The deep, soft couches, pillows and overstuffed chairs lining the exposed brick walls make seating very limited. The only bar is really a window in the back of the club where waitstaff shuffle back and forth taking drink orders and generally creating poor traffic flow. 

My recommendation would be to arrive early with a group of friends and claim a good space or for the more adventurous couple/date, grab a good spot and order some of the tasty appetizers and watch all the fresh Nike kids work on their break dancing routines.

Let me first apologize in advance for offending any vegetarians or those of you that are trying to reduce your carbon footprint and then give it a try:  fresh, delicious cuts of meat, organic choices at prices unbeknownst to those of us in Vancouver proper, knowledgeable servers and butchers that know the details of cuts and the origin of the meats, specialty items that originate in France or the UK and are then carefully and lovingly raised locally and often organically. If you consider yourslef an omnivore (or a carnivore!?!) then Heringers is worth a drive south. 

They also make deli items on site and they offer a meatloaf that is unequaled. Meatloaf! There is an excellent selection of mustards and other condiments that are happy accompaniments for your selections of prime cuts and there are cheeses, smoked meats, various dips and dressings and treats to choose from.

1667,NDDOxJY7QwAizD04eOXWpw,"I visited this restaurant with some colleagues since we are in Orlando for a work conference. The environment seems fun with loud music and dancing. However, the food and service were mediocre at best.

I ordered a souvlaki platter with gyro, and the food was good, but very much felt like it was something I could've gotten at a food court for $5 instead of at a sit-down restaurant for $15. It wasn't quite what I expected - more just a gyro wrap with fries rather than a ""platter"" per se. Nothing was bad about it, but really there's also nothing positive to say either. The gyro came with fries covered in grated cheese, which was good. I also sampled my friend's lemon pork, which was tasty. Grilled pork often comes out dry, but this one was not.

I do feel like commenting, though, that service felt lacking. Given it was the evening of New Years Day, and I appreciate people working so I can eat, but it often felt like our server favored another table over ours. We ordered two sides of tzatziki sauce and asked for more water, but ten minutes later we were still waiting. We had to ask about it again, and the server insisted he had previously sent out the tzatziki. He brought it out quickly with some extra pita, and we asked for more water again, since our cups were still empty. Even getting our server's attention was a challenge as he quickly passed us each time without even looking our direction. I wonder if the poor service was due to our group being entirely ethnic minorities (2 Asian, 1 Latino, 3 Black, 1 Middle Eastern...the other table that seemed to be favored did not have any.) I don't know and can't know for sure.

We have 5 people in our party, when we placed the order for the guacamole, the server asked us since we have 5 people, do we want to have one more avocado for the guacamole. We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.

When we compare out guacamole to the ""single"" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.

There is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much.",3.0

Every dentist that I have gone too has treated me in a sub-human way because, unfortunately I was not blessed with the greatest of teeth, and was treated as if I didn't care about them so they didn't care what they did to them. 
This is THE place to go to be treated with kindness, compassion, non- judgment and complete professionalism. 
Dr. Daby did not do what every other Dentist has done to me like just saying ""your teeth and gums are beyond repair so when you are ready I'll pull them all out for you when you get dentures."" Instead, he did a through exam and found teeth that could stay and recommended a partial. 
All the preparation before getting the actual partial was completely painless and all of his staff were so kind and considerate. Not ""condescendingly kind,"" but ""truly"" kind. 
When the day came for the actual ""pulling"" of my teeth (I only lost six!) I was very nervous and anxious. My sister came with me to hold my hand and support me through it and it went very well, after it was all finished and I saw myself in the mirror it made me cry. All of my worst fears were for not and I am SO happy with the results.

My wife ordered the bagel with Lox, onions, and cream cheese. She said it was pretty good, but it could have used a bit more cream cheese. I ordered the Chicken Panini with artichoke and it was very tasty.  We both ordered a strawberry lemonade and thought it was made to order, but when the attendant handed us our food she mentioned the strawberry lemonade is kept in the cooler section along with the milk, OJ, and cream cheese. 

My wife mentioned the place was rather cold inside, and it felt a tad unwelcoming because of it.  The restroom is a one-bloke-at-a-time type of deal, so if the place is busy, you may have to wait to use the facilities.  

Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing to rant and rave about.  If you're hungry and you're in the area you can stop in for a quick meal that is slightly overpriced.  Don't make a drive just to eat here, though.  It's just not that type of place.",3.0

It was chilled, which they must do to make sure they stay fresh, but then that makes me wonder if they aren't freshly baked. This also comes down to personal preference, I love warm, gooey cookies and these were cold and hard. 

My friend ordered the 7-layer bar and a chocolate chip cookie. The chocolate chip was the same as mine and the bar was just ""meh."" It had all the right ingredients, but there was nothing special or different about it. The bar tasted too generic and store bought, not homemade.

They only had a couple cupcakes available (maybe 6?) and they didn't have any cake although they had plenty of signs saying that they are famous for it.

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back.

1716,_1wjxzfZXDFf67KHQUSU9Q,"One of my favorite spots in metro Atlanta for all the best reasons: stellar food, consistent drinks and cheap prices. What more do you need?

Whether or not this place is an authentic Spanish joint is not the point; Eclipse serves such a wide variety of tapas that the important thing is that you'll find something here for everyone. 

My personal suggestions would be the pan catalan, which are strips of crusty ciabatta with something that looks like Cheez Whiz but is actually a tomato and thyme purée -- it never fails to get first-timers into the tapas-style meals. 

The Costilla ribs are also excellent, roasted in aged balsamic to perfect softness. And if you're a seafood nut, you'll go crazy for the paella negra. The dark, inky color can be a bit off-putting, but tasty nonetheless. Make sure to order it first thing, since it takes 35 minutes to cook. 

Naturally, the sangria is a MUST. I've been here three times in the past month and the sangria has been on point each time. Mojitos are another good option. Once dinner is over, head a few store up to Cafe Intermezzo to finish off a very European night.

A few downsides: lighting is too dark, far too loud on salsa nights, inconsistent service from servers who are dressed way too casually in the festive atmosphere, and the extensive menu, which can be a plus, but not when you have Anglos in your party who cannot pronounce Spanish words to save their life.",4.0

The décor of the place is sleek, clean and modern. It is easily missable as it doesn't fit the rest of the feel of the traditional stores nearby. 

Outside the store front is a really warm and cute story about the café. You get a real sense of community from one generation to another. 

The owner was super friendly and patient. The best coffee house experience I have had in a long time. 

This café is close to my home and carries both gluten and sugar free treats. The combination of the two are hard to find. Finally a café that can specifically cater to my culinary needs. 

I tried the lavender chocolate sugar/gluten free bar. Just the right amount of lavender that complements the chocolate. A treat that felt guilt free in my mouth.

We saw the relatively milquetoast reviews for Austin Ale House but decided to check it out anyway. It was a slow early afternoon, and the place was pretty empty.

They were nice and tried to offer two beers they did have on tap as samples, but they were completely different from the wheat beers I had ordered (and one was actually a cider). When you go to a place with ""ale house"" in the name, you expect the staff to be knowledgeable - at least about what they have on tap.

I always get the burrito in a bowl.  The softness of the burrito itself getting stuck to the roof of my mouth is really unappealing so I prefer the burrito in a bowl eaten with chips. Of the burrito assembly line restaurants sweeping the nation, Moe's chips are a little below average for me.  They could be fresher and more salty. In terms of ingredients, I always opt for the grilled vegetables i.e. onions and peppers over grilled meat. Sometimes they can get a little heavy handed with the rice so make sure you keep them in check if you don't want a meal that is 75% rice.  Maybe you are super into rice though in which case the more rice the merrier. 

The guac and queso are always pretty good and the salsa bar is acceptable once you stir up the stagnant salsas a bit. Also, I would like to note that their nachos are HUGE.

We found using our credit card out at the kiosk outside was quicker for ingress than waiting in line to pay in person which we would have paid via credit card anyway so that just made the process quicker.

For me, the salmon with spinach and bacon bits special. Spinach tasted like spinach but nothing special. The bacon, which is nearly impossible to make taste bad, sucked. The salmon had been cooked so long that skin on the bottom was burnt to the fish and couldn't be removed. Also, they topped it with a garnish of pickled fiddlehead ferns, which didn't mix well and was kind of gross.

Altogether the price came out to $75, which is a hell of a lot for really crappy food.

Overall? Never. Going. Back.",1.0
1742,VlyZnGhzbuLbzznNRf4HOg,"I headed to The Cellar after a work Christmas party with a girlfriend. We were both dressed up (admittedly overdressed for this young, casual, pick-up spot) and looking for some good dancing that had not played out at the office party. I was approached by a fairly good looking guy who tried what is now #2 on my list of ""Most Ballsy Pick-Up Lines Ever."" 

After dancing with me for a while, he said ""You look like a Christmas candy that I would like to unwrap and lick.""  If this is the kind of attention you're looking for, head to the cellar. BTW, I was not looking for this type of attention and the line crashed and burned, but was memorable.

P.S. In case you're wondering, #1 on the list of ""Most Ballsy Pick-Up Lines Ever"" is held by a guy who bought me a shooter in Ottawa. I asked what it was. He said ""It's an orgasm. I'll give you another one later,"" (wink). That's ballsy.

1745,XmB_4zuY1Dwj5MJnBCaYQw,"On this cold and rainy night our party of four adults decided to visit the neighborhood pub, Blue Ribbon, located on the way home in a shopping center.  It's very dark and pub-like inside with dark woods and a rather tired and outdated decor.  The booths and tables have seen better days and could use a sprucing or recovering.  The large bar is on the left and wraps around the dining / main seating area.  We were greeted and seated immediately and given menus.  Our waiter was very friendly and jovial, introduced himself and took our drink orders.

The menu has a few appetizers, three soup selections, a few salads, burgers, sandwiches --plus unusual pub fare such as chicken pot pie, meatloaf, chili and fried shrimp or fish.  They also offer a couple of steaks, salmon and desserts.  Tonight we tried the fish n chips, the spinach salad, the chicken tenders platter and the ribeye with a baked potato and salad.  Our beer and bar drinks arrived and then we waited 40 minutes for the salads and another 25 for the entrees.  It seemed way too long to wait especially since it was not busy or crowded.

When the entrees came they were ok but cold; the baked potato's butter didn't melt because the potato was too cool.  The fish was heavily breaded but the fries and cole slaw were pretty good.  The steak was cold and tasted old like it had been sitting in a refrigerator for a while.  Chicken tenders with sweet potato fries were good but needed to be hotter in temperature.  Spinach salad was large and the vinaigrette on the side had been warmed.

Total for two beers, two bar drinks and four entrees was $104.90 including tip.",3.0

I was already kind of surprised I was charge 3 extra dollars for white meat. I felt the food was over priced considering most Jamaican spots dinner is under $15 for chicken dishes. My roti was hard I was not able to eat that. I ended up going to by food somewhere else after I had spent $23.00 on 1 dinner with roti and beverage. I will never ever go back. The people inside was cool but being from nyc I know you don't have to make Jamaican food so spicy and it ends up with no flavor just HOT! It was a waste of money for me.

The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.

I also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.

I tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.",2.0
1751,7RP_ndpBFj4MK5KqRu-jvQ,"I went ot Bao Asian Fusion again with my family, and although our entrees tasted good, details made me wonder about the quality/cleanliness of the place.  
The water had a funny taste, it might be because of the ice cubes, like sometimes if you don't use them for a while they have that bad flavor.
We ordered sushi and also Chinese dishes for each of us.  I wish they'd asked us in what order we wanted the plates. Instead, we got the hot dishes first and then the sushi a few minutes later.  
Lastly, we could not even eat the tiramisu.  Both my daughter and I found it had a strange taste, kind of a chemical taste. It did not look like a Tiramisu either (and I don't blame them, after all, this is not an Italian restaurant), more like a sad little (previously) frozen thing.

Sides are a hit or miss. If you want some cheesy potato-ey goodness, definitely get the baked potato casserole. It's carb heaven. The green bean casserole is alright - it's not as creamy or tasty as the version I make myself. Coleslaw was bland and unmentionable. I would not order it again. I was a fan of the broccoli salad for some reason -  maybe I was just craving something light, sweet, and vinegary, but it hit the spot that day.

I could do without the dogs as it just added a touch of chaos to an already sort of noisy atmosphere, but I guess that's part of their vibe.

I then asked if they had the oreo cake batter. He replied very rudely that they didn't have that which prompted me to ask what they did in fact have available.

He said everything else. So I then ordered the white coffee. He asked me if I'd had it before and I said no. He then TOLD ME I had to taste it before I ordered it. UHM EXCUSE ME!?! I'm the customer! I don't have to freaking taste it if I don't want to. BUT he didn't give me a choice. After tasting the ice cream, I told my boyfriend that we had to leave. 

The guy was so rude I will NEVER EVER go back to JP Licks. ALSO, my company is sponsoring a spin-a-thon for the Jimmy Fund and I had considered asking JP Licks to be one of our smaller sponsors which would have provided them with a good bit of free publicity. Now I DEFINITELY WON'T ask them to participate. I don't want a company with such bad customer service aligned with my company. INSTEAD I WILL ASK COLDSTONE to be a sponsor.

We ordered naeng myun (cold noodles) and budae jjigae (Korean army stew), which were good but again, nothing too special. My first budae jjigae was in Korea, and this restaurant's version didnt meet my expectations.  The stew flavor was missing something and it needed more spam & rice cakes. They use udon noodles, but it usually comes with ramen (which we prefer).",3.0
1790,OxLpbZTbUUi2Vu9ZpVwa5A,"I've heard great things about this place from friends, but after coming here a few times under a few different sets of circumstances, I have to say I probably won't be coming back. First of all, parking is a nightmare. This is a huge place on the strip that's pretty busy during open hours, so the 8 parking spots in front are always full. But all around you are ""towing enforced"" signs for all the other shops with too few parking spaces, so you've usually got to plan for a good long walk ahead of you. That can be a pain if you're coming there to sell clothes, both coming in AND going out (because you WILL be leaving with 95% of the clothes you came with). Which brings me to my next ""meh"" experience: selling clothes. I went there yesterday with my fiance and the casualties of our closet-cleaning- all the stuff we don't fit into anymore. We had called ahead and had been told that they were accepting mostly fall-winter items, long-sleeved stuff, sweaters, high-end stuff and stuff they have too little of. We brought all our cold-weather stuff- probably about 100 items in all. Out of our assortment of long-sleeved Ben Sherman shirts, Ben Sherman pants (new with tags!), my favorite (but way too small) black suede faux-fur lined jacket and tons of fall-colored slacks and other formal stuff, they took ONE thing. ONE THING. A brown sweater. We took the $2.88 cash instead of store credit. Which brings me to my next complaint- selection. Did I mention my fiance and I had a lot of great stuff to sell because it was too small? We all know what happens when you haven't been single for awhile. No I'm not a size 14 anymore. And that means that the only thing I can shop for at Buffalo Exchange are shoes. They don't buy or sell anything larger than a 16 for women and probably a 38 for men. Sad! Not saying they're fatty haters, and I certainly understand the concept of not offering something you can't make money on- but if that's their argument I find it hard to believe. There were plenty of other women there shopping who looked to be my size- but all leaving with nothing, or with shoes or jewelry. This is Texas, for crying out loud. There are some bigger girls here than what fit into a 16. Again, sad. Their prices are also not that great- they say they prefer to sell items that were in department stores ""within the last 6-18 months,"" but what they don't say on the website is that their prices are pretty close to what you'd see in deparment stores in the last 6-18 months as well. Jewelry and shoes notwithstanding. Now for the good- customer service and location. The staff are always SUPER friendly, more-so than your average college-town hipsters, and they're right next to Toy Joy, so when you leave disappointed with a car full of clothes you don't want (or empty-handed), at least you have somewhere to go to cheer you up. It could be worse. If you're not selling and you're skinny and you drive a scooter or bicycle or walked there, you'll probably love it.",2.0

It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet.

When the food came Mool Naengmyun (cold noodle with soup) tasted alright. The soup was sour and sweet which I didn't mind. Meat slice topping was so dry it wasn't good. And the waitress helped cutting noodle twice that I ended up scooping the noodles. She did it in the rush I think. As for boneless chicken it was lukewarm. Should've been hot and crispy at first bite. It didn't impress me.

However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don't expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to ""choosing our car"" (I am an Emerald's Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it's FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant's help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...

If this restaurant were anywhere else, I'd give it 0-1 stars. Chips were cold, salsa had no kick and was runny (as in, no chunks of tomatoes or onions). I had sangria, which I realize is not really authentic mex, but it was NOT GOOD. No fruit, entirely too sweet, and you couldn't see through it (sangria should be translucent, not opaque).  
The last and biggest offense... the $$$. For fair to middlin' mexican food, this place has some pretty steep prices (many entrees were between $15-20). 
In all honesty, if given the choice between taco bell and this place, I'd probably choose Taco Bell.

But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables).

The drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a ""Bucharaht"" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it.

The bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay).

The best thing about this restaurant is its happy hour, so check out the early evening and late-night menu with great deals on your basic Tex-Mex fare and some quite dandy house margaritas.

We asked to sit at a bar top table to get a few drinks, we were told no, however another group was allowed.  I tried to ask the hostess who gave me some serious attitude why.

I also know far to much about that hostess sex life then I wanted to...  Then she the proceeded to sit everyone else but us, even people that had arrived only 5 mintues ago.

Don't make this mistake, otherwise you will be slipping all over your mat because it will be soaked in sweat in the first 15 minutes.  Bring a towel both for your mat and second small one to wipe your sweat!

I like to hit up Adam's class on Sunday late afternoon or Lara's slow flow class on Monday nights.  Adam's classes are a great workout, which is awesome.  I know if I go to his classes often I will get pretty strong and toned, but he also keeps you centered mentally.  It's great.  Lara's classes are great as well - I feel like I am going to therapy when I leave her classes because I feel good physically but also mentally/spiritually.  All of the instructors talk during class, but I especially like her vibe!  I've only taken one of Rebecca's classes, but it was a lot of fun - she's almost playful with the poses and she keeps it pretty light.  She does a good job describing the poses too.  So far, every instructor I have gone to have been great and I like that they each have their own distinct style and personality, so I tend to pick which class to go to depending on what I'm looking to get out of the class.

1831,G7MtzppNJD3EcTgNvtysAg,"Primarily seafood restaurant at expense-account-steakhouse prices.  Nice selection of fish --some of which are fairly unusual in the Atlanta market-- priced by the pound.  A 3/4 lb (typical) portion of fish averages $30.  Not unreasonable until you realize that's...just a grilled piece of fish.  Period.  Add an appetizer and a couple of sides, and you're at $75 --not including drink, tax & tip.    Is the food good?  Yeah.  Is it worth the price?  Not in my opinion, given that you can easily get an equally good fish meal elsewhere at half the price.",3.0

Negative: EXPENSIVE!!! $3.25 for 3 pieces of har gao?? It usually costs less than $3 for 4 pieces at other places. I wish their servings came in fours instead of threes (makes it more convenient for sharing between two people). Quality was just alright. It tasted...different...not in a bad way, but not what I'm used to. 

Perhaps I'm biased because I grew up on more authentic Houston dim sum.

I don't know if they do this for everyone, but they played the old ""Roto Rooter"" fixed-price game with me whereby they show-up, size-up the job, size-up the customer, and then quote an outrageously high price for the job.  Too pressured to think clearly, the customer agrees and regrets it afterwords.  

What's outrageous?  I paid $682 to replace two faucets.  It was all straightforward work on modern sinks in a 5 year old condo.

GrubHub reached out to the restaurant who said they were starting my order and promised it would be delivered in 25-30 ADDITIONAL minutes.  The restaurant had confirmed this, and I was told they were offering the delivery service directly.  OK, fine, at least I will get to eat dinner, and at this point it's too late to order delivery or pickup anywhere else.

At 3.5 hours, I contacted them again and subsequently received an email saying the order was cancelled because it was after 9:00, and the restaurant was closed.  I realize the GrubHub shares the blame here, but this is abysmal customer service from City Thai.  It is honestly inexcusable.  It is one thing to need to cancel an order because of weather, or driver issues, etc, but to provide (sparse) updates confirming that the order will be delivered and then simply close is un-freaking-believable.

First of all, the ceiling...crawling with dust bunnies. Seriously, when  you walk in, look up. That grey stuff you see off the brown ceiling paint is dust. And that fan circulating it around? Yep, covered in dust. Which is strange that it is only the section of the ceiling  located right at the entrance. The other sections of the ceiling are fine.

Secondly, $1 grilled cheese Mondays - overrated. While I raved before, having gone back and had and/or attempted to enjoy the special, it's nothing to waste your time for. The grilled cheese has become bready and bland. Yes, it's only a dollar and you get chips, but I'd rather just make my own bomb-ass grilled cheese at home -without the hour (or sometimes two) wait.

Thirdly, the noise level. Loud as fuck, any time of the day. Music blasts, people have to scream over each other. Downright annoys me because my friends are constantly saying, ""huh? what?"" And I hate repeating myself.

Lastly, the space/size. TINY. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a ""constant"" flow of patrons, as in they go in, order their bar, and then can chill off to the side or on a patio. Nope, as soon as you enter Bodega, you pretty much have to stay cramped in the same spot.

The problems started with the service. Our waitress was rather brisk and not particularly attentive--in the course of a 45 minute brunch we were only checked on once aside from ordering and food being delivered, leading to empty water glasses. Such a transgression could be understandable if the place was packed, but with less than half the tables filled it was disappointing. One member of our party was vegan and made a few specific requests i.e. ordering just a side of potatoes--she received potato pancakes instead, which the waitress took back but did not offer to remedy.
I had the pepper bacon and cheddar hash, which was pretty good but not phenomenal. While the ingredients were fresh and high-quality, it lacked a certain panache as well as originality and I found myself drowning it in salt, pepper, and ketchup. The brioche and chevre breakfast sandwich was eaten by another member of my party without negative comment. On the other hand, the oatmeal seemed to be comprised of raw oats with hot water poured over them, not soaked in water, leading to an inconsistent consistency and some crunchy oats. Additionally, the proportions of oatmeal to toppings was way off; halfway through the bowl there was only unappealing oatmeal remaining and no fruits to balance it out. Meh.

Other than seeing people eat with their hands you never would guess you were in an Ethiopian place.  Lets be honest Ethiopian food does not conjure up thoughts of heavenly good eats nor makes your mouth salivated upon mentioning its cuisine like lets say Grandma's meatballs.

1885,oUFtNpRdx_l2oXQw4qoonA,"We brought our pup to paws up on the recommendation of a friend. He started there at 3 months old and was only going once a week for some socialization and just fun for him. For about 2 months we didn't hear anything but glowing reviews about him. Then we started to get feedback about him not socializing well.  

After one visit we were told if he didn't improve he wouldn't be welcome back. I asked what we could do to help him be better pup and they recommended training, hanging out with dogs more and going to dog parks. They told us he needed to be brought there before 930 am. If we took these actions and they saw improvement they would continue to take him. 

We were a little taken back as this was something we never saw at home but took it seriously. We took a 3 week break from paws up and began work to help our guy. We went to dog parks, brought him everywhere we could and hired a trainer to help. Everything we saw was positive and decided to bring him back to paws up. 

My girlfriend brought him and was told he was not welcome until training was complete and re-evaluation let him back in. This was NOT what was told to me the last time I went there. I was told they would still take him with the understanding he was on thin ice as long we began doing all the thing they recommended. We took every action they told us and are taken back by the refusal of our dog. 

I took everything that was said to us very seriously and worked to rectify the situation.  We saw no issues with socialization outside paws up but still took the steps they recommended. To be denied and my girlfriend lied to about what was said to me makes me furious.

And they outfitted me with Sugpo Asin and Tsushima No Moshio, two salts that perfectly fit that order and are excellent on more delicately-flavored dishes such as fish.  Expensive?  Well, more so than Morton's, that's for sure.  But this is finishing salt; you use it by the small pinch.  And it adds so much to the dish.  So, it is expensive, but well worth it.  Plan to spend a half-hour or so just chatting with the knowledgeable staff and tasting the salts; it will be time well-spent and an amazing, broadening education.

They also have an amazing selection of chocolate both for direct eating and also for cooking.  This comprehensive selection -- doubtlessly the best in Portland -- includes some world-class entries.

One of the first things I noticed upon perusing the beer selection is the availability of Real Ale Fireman's #4 in bottles.  Whoo hoo!  Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.

I was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.

There is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.  Yum!

However, this latest experience today with Chris was beyond ridiculous.    Send me a private message if you'd like a link to a recording of my call with him.

First, I have had historic problems getting Amplify's online technology to work in my favor.  Very, very bad website, auto pay, etc. makes it almost impossible to work with them in a 2015 manner.    This wouldn't be a huge problem if I didn't spend huge amounts of time offline, traveling, life, etc. and had the time to babysit my monthly payment.

Today, I called to catch up my payments AGAIN due to their technological failure to honor the auto-pay their own rep helped me set up in June.  After politely (listen to the call) asking Chris to escalate my call to somebody who cares, at a higher level, about the Amplify reputation, he took great offense (listen to the call), spent over a minute berating me for being late on my payments (listen to the call) and ultimately said to call their attorney and hung up on me.  I was blown away.  So were my co workers in the office who heard the call as it was on speaker phone, thus my recording....thank you Scott.

The biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.

There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.

The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.

It was the three soup hot pot that caught my attention.  That was why we came here to try it out despite the so so reviews.  Thanks to local celebs Chelsea and Pam.  Best thanks to Fellow Yelpers who posted this place. (Btw Chelsea and Pam are from the YouTube show HBICTV. Go watch it) 
Now...
Despite what I've read, the service was decent.  Our server spoke both Chinese and English.  So if any of you hipsters want to try it out, it's pretty easy. ( remember don't be afraid to ask for stuff )

The menu is AYCE priced just under $21 with a listing of items available to order.  Below that there are items that are not pert of the AYCE menu like the soup options from $9.99 to $14.99. Your choice of one soup, two soups or three soups.  We opted for the three soup option.  
There were also some appetizers to choose from and a list of drinks and sauces.

Expect to pay at least $30/person.

Veggies - decent selection good quality
Meat slices - pork was freezer burnt but the other meats were ok if not paper thin. 
Lamb was the exception and was thicker and not frozen.
Vegetarian options are good, but not Vegan. 

The soups we ordered were 
1) spicy chili - oily but spicy but not Chongqing style.  
2) Tomato we all liked that the best.
3) chicken 

How to order your hot pot items? Just put a tick next to the item you want.  If you need more later, just ask for it. 
Need more soups? Ask.
Need plates? Ask. 

Overall, I give them 3 stars which for AYCE is decent.  Our meal between the six of us was $32 Cash each.  And yes it's Cash only.

Both times, my experience of dining here was ruined by either improper cooking or bad service. Otherwise, the food taste was good. 

So don't go here for the experience at all. Don't know about Non-vegetarian dishes but they might be good too.",2.0

Each visit the staff was attentive and cared about our experience. On my second visit they remembered me by name! 

We did the omakase at the sushi bar (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and our personal sushi Chef Ray along with Chef Brian gave us an amazing tasting of nigiri while showing us and explaining each special treatment of the fish. All of the staff, including the management, stopped by to say happy birthday and check if we needed anything. 

this is my favorite place for Japanese cocktails. Each time I went back to the Classic Lolita (Japanese Old Fashion) and Porco Rosso (named after my favorite cartoon character!).

1930,3eEA34ZIZ4YTU_az3XTjuQ,"WOW. Only word I can use to describe our experience yesterday through this morning.

We got one of the huge suites as it was a special occasion and everything about its appointment, the staff service, all of it was first rate.

Who doesn't need a TV that comes on in the bathroom mirror and has reflected screens in the shower? I mean, c'mon.

The palatial suite was about 1400 square feet so beyond luxurious for a couple and with those kind of doors that lock on both sides that connect to other rooms, it would be ideal for a group/family gathering. My fiance had requested an assortment of pink roses in vases, and spread all over the suite, and it was amazing and gorgeous and so special. We don't drink so our ""welcome treat' was those special size Diet Cokes in tin cans and chocolate covered strawberries. 

Valet parking was complimentary with this level room, and as we were on the Club Level, there was a lovely room with tons of seating, small tables, arm chairs, and such with meals/drinks/snacks through the day at almost all hours. The breakfast might be called ""continental"" but it was only a hair ""less than"" the spread downstairs. The fluffiest eggs (my absolute fave are well done hotel spread eggs), a ton of perfect fruit, Irish oatmeal, a coffee machine that makes every drink you could want, breakfast burritos....I could keep going since I love breakfast food so much!

The hotel was BUZZING with the football folks, another big event going on in a large ballroom, I'm sure what was just early holiday traffic, and everyone we encountered was pleasant, helpful and just lovely.

I loved everything about my fiance's idea that yesterday should be a ""trial run"" of sorts for our wedding NEXT December 1 and the InterContinental was a super place to choose for the royal treatment.",5.0

Right off Congress in the shade, small picnic tables and a few chairs. It's right next to the Austin Juice trailer. (Which is also in my passbook, I plan to try that soon!)

We ordered the Croque-Madame. And then ordered a custom sandwich with a Hawaiian bun, cheddar, ham, an egg, spinach, and jalapeño cream cilantro sauce. 

It was tough for me to decide which one I liked better but I think I settled on the Croque-Madame. It was a little sweet but the flavors combines were amazing. 

Our custom sandwich wound up being really good too, mostly thanks to the sauce. I highly recommend the jalapeño cream cilantro sauce.  It wasn't spicy to me at all but it had an amazing flavor. I'm a sucker for anything cilantro. 

*The sourdough bread did get a little soggy, but it didn't bother me (might bother others). The Hawaiian bun stayed pretty toasted and crispy.*

Our sides were a fruit cup and tomato soup (cute!). The fruit cup was green apples and oranges, refreshing and the fruit tasted fresh. The tomato soup was good. Had some chunks in it, probably tomatoes. So that was a strange consistency, but the taste was really good. I think having tomato soup at a grilled cheese trailer is a great idea.

The rotisserie chicken was OK, we got a few sides of the wasakaka sauce and it made all the difference. I have had wasakaka sauce before in Dominican Republic which is where I grew up. It's basically a mix of oregano, parsley, olive oil, garlic and some other things. The wasakaka here is pretty good... My ONLY recommendation would be time the heat just a tad bit down, if you put too much on your chicken it's hard to eat! Other than that it was delicious. We got 2 sides of the loaded mashed potatoes which were DELICIOUS! I can eat a pint of just that! Our other side was their version of ""rice and beans"" but with chickpeas I believe. It was good and would get it again. I'm not much a fan of cornbread so I didn't try it so I can't really say anything about that.

1939,99FOJLySehGZqMid8CjLfw,"When I come to visit my family in Atlanta, Octane + Little Tart Bakeshop and Cakes & Ale are our go-to coffee shops.  We're pretty picky about our food - particularly coffees, teas, and desserts - but Octane never disappoints.  (Neither, for the record, does Cakes & Ale.)

Pros:
-The baked goods from Little Tart Bakeshop are truly divine.  The meringues, chocolate/caramel tarts, and basque tarts are particular favorites.  You can tell that all of the ingredients are high-quality, the recipes are tried-and-true, and the bakers are highly skilled.
-I'm a tea drinker, and I am thrilled that Octane offers loose-leaf Rishi Tea.  Yay!
-I'm not a coffee drinker, but my parents are, and they both very much enjoy the coffee at Octane.  They are extremely picky when it comes to coffee, so this is definitely a compliment. 
-In contrast to other reviewers, I've found the waitstaff to be perfectly pleasant and polite every time I've been there.  The male cashier with the gage earrings and the tattoos is particularly friendly and helpful.  Of course, I have only been here a handful of times, so who knows?
-It's a neat loft space with high ceilings, plenty of light, and a rustic retro feel.
-Although the patrons (and servers) largely appear to be ""hipsters,"" unlike other reviewers, I have never personally had an issue with any of them being judgey, impolite, or at all unpleasant during my visits to Octane.  That said, I've only been here a few times myself.

Cons:
-The chairs (as other reviewers have mentioned) are small, hard, and singularly uncomfortable.  
-Most of the tables wobble.
-In the summertime, the shop is virtually un-airconditioned, with two tiny ceiling fans providing next-to-no air circulation.  This makes it particularly difficult to enjoy a hot tea, which is my preferred beverage, when I'm already sweltering.  I can only imagine how overheated the servers, cooks, and bakers must be hanging out over ovens and stoves in the back.  However, the temperature is fine during other seasons of the year.

Overall, I would highly recommend Octane + the Little Tart Bakeshop  However, you may want to wait it out until slightly cooler months of the year to enjoy their delectable desserts and delicious drinks.  Although I've never had them myself, my family has told me that their sandwiches and quiches are also wonderful.  If possible, it would be great if the chairs, tables, and AC could be fixed, but otherwise this place is truly excellent, and the food & drinks are perfect.  Yum!",5.0

It's a beautiful little restaurant with indoor and outdoor dining.  There were more people sitting outside, but since it was around 94 degrees outside, I decided to eat my dinner inside.

This was a very different-looking menu compared to other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to.  I settled on the filet mignon tibs, injera, Shiro (chickpeas), Gomen (collard greens), Tikel Gomen (cabbage), Miser (spicy red lentil stew), and a Harar Beer. 
Everything was delicious, but it was much less spicy than I was used to.

I am SO glad I found this place tonight. It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.
For about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. 

So I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.

AND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.",5.0

The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. 

I really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age.

The service is usually pretty bad.  You might have to wait to find someone to take your order and regardless of what time of day you're there, you will definitely be waiting for a while to get your order.  
(My favorite thing to do is stand at the end of the counter, in front of the machine they use to track orders.  After 3 minutes your order turns red and flashes. It probably won't keep you entertained for the next 3 minutes, though.)

My experience with the food has been totally hit or miss.  I tried a teriyaki wrap and found it barely edible.  I'd recommend staying away from the wraps involving brown rice--super crunchy.  On the other hand, I had the portabello sandwich the other day and it was pretty good.

I know this place is supposed to be ""healthy"", but I would really like *some* slightly junk-food toppings on the frozen yogurt.

I called 20 minutes before to see if they accepted walk ins and was told by the gentleman who answered the phones they did so I took the drive to the salon. Upon entering it was very dark, maybe because they call themselves a spa it was part of the ambiance. It was not very clean and many of the stations seemed to be crowded with junk. I wanted just a gel polish change but they would only let me do it with a manicure. I had to take it upon myself to find the board that had the gel polish nail colors. And most of them seemed old, definitely not a color selection that's impressing. The guy doing my nails seemed to be in a rush and was not paying attention to what he was doing. My nails were not filed straight and when I pointed it out he got annoyed. Then when buffing my nailed he cut the skin on my fingers. Don't even get me started on my cuticles that are worse now than when he started. I will not be back, and maybe it was just my experience but it was not work the $30 they charge for a crappy ""manicure"". Look at the other options in the area.",1.0

The location is Jewry close to the airport.  So if you are just using this location for sleeping I would say do it.  The charter driver was hesitant about helping me with my bags. We were told we could get a ride to near by restaurants which were only 2 options but because he had another pick up he dropped us off at his closest convince and not the one that was discussed.  Where he just walked over to the train station going somewhere else.  The staff at the desk was great.  My review is based on the shuttle driver and the air conditioning of the room.,2.0

1972,_cSb7SN_SdS8GTk33rKNOw,"These cupcakes are TERRIBLE!!  I've been to both the Chestnut Hill and now the Cambridge locations and both suffer from lack of freshness and a very artificial taste.  

Most recently, I got a 6 pack of cupcakes to go at the Cambridge location which cost me a total of $19.15 (about $3.20 each).  When I got home, I realized cupcake carrier they use is not sufficient - the cupcakes are so tiny that they shifted around in the box and made a little bit of a mess (see photo).  The cupcakes weren't for any special presentation, just to satisfy my late night sweet tooth, so I didn't mind their appearance. 

But I can not tolerate the staleness of the cupcakes and their very artificial taste - not when I'm paying $3.20 each for a cupcake about an inch and 1/2 in diameter!!  I had a pink lemonade, rootbeer float, and a blueberry pie.  ALL TERRIBLE TASTING!   I don't even want the other 3 I purchased so they are going in the trash.

Ahi Tuna tartar was outstanding. Great flavor super fresh. Chilled gulf shrimp was good, large and fresh.

1982,55SbWH2jITMJf8G7J_omWA,"I normally get pretty stuffed for cheap at Cajun/Southern joints because of the affordable portion sizes, but here, the food was a bit steep.  More food=more stars.  They would have gotten 4 from me had they stretched my meal with maybe another scoop of 2 or rice per dish.

I had the etouffee and gumbo.  Each came with a small scoop of rice.  The liquid to-go containers were extremely nice.  They were large, tightly sealed plastic boxes that did not leak any of that Louisianian goodness.  That is probably the last time I will ever write a review about to-go packaging... but I was very impressed.

The crawfish etouffee was a little lighter than most.  It was a more tomato-y type sauce.  It was red, slightly tangy, and there was plenty of tender crawfish swimming around.  It was not as flavorful as some of the others I have had before, but it would have been a great pasta sauce or something.

The gumbo was a little runnier than I prefer.  It was plenty dark, but it lacked that rich flavor.  I classify it as a soup in my book, but it is definitely a flavorful soup.  There was a little too much sausage, as I prefer my gumbo ratio to lean heavier on the seafood side.  The chicken meat was extremely tender and tasty, though.  There was some tender shrimp mixed in also.

Crazy Cajun offers solid Cajun food, but I would like a little bit more food and some zippier flavor.  Do check it out if you are in the Asian part of town and are hankerin' for some non-Asian food... although the guy that runs CC is Asian!  Who would have thought?",3.0

I figure we should get here early as I hate waiting for food.  Anyways we got here and there were already half way full, usually a good sign. So the thing to remember here is, their menu changes daily. We were here on a Sunday I believe, there 3 choices for the ramen and 2 choices for the side orders. Chicken karaage and pot stickers. I read one of the reviewers raving about the pot stickers, so I decided to order it as well. This is how unmemorable this place was too me, as I write this review down I couldn't even for the love of me remember the type of ramen I ordered. I wasn't keen in eating anything spicy that early in the day so I opt out on the ramen that didn't offer any heat at all. We ordered at the counter and service was quick and friendly. I really wanted to like this place, but it was such a disappointment. The ramen, was just okay. I've definitely had better and for $10 bucks, I've expected more.

The pizza: the crust was terrible quality, like thin, weak tasting stale white bread. The sauce was tasteless and the vegetables were overcooked and the chicken was totally dried out.

Hell, who am I kidding?  Even at the discount rate it was an awful experience.

We were supposed to all be together, and while we were mostly on the same floor (but not all of us), we were scattered about on that floor.  But that's fine, I understand...even though the request was made and confirmed months in advance.  Part of this was because they thought everyone in the party had arrived, even after admitting that they had JUST been told two of couples were half an hour away, they had given our rooms to someone else!

When I checked in I was enthusiastically told I was ""upgraded"" from a double room to a King room (which is what I had booked anyway), and it was one of the newly renovated rooms!  How exciting, right?  Except it was right on the atrium, which is heavily under construction.  I get it, hotels need to remodel on occasion, but they just did not handle this well.  We were told what hours work was scheduled and that the evenings/night/mornings were quiet time.  HA!  Construction started over an hour early each day and went well into the evenings.  Being woken up at 6:30AM on a Saturday by loud yelling and heavy equipment was not fun.  It was even less fun on Sunday.

The TV has annoying settings to force you to see ads and such - took multiple clicks to actually watch the damn thing.

The WiFi was really bad.  I was able to surf the net, and pictures on Facebook and the like took only a tad bit to load, but could not even attempt to stream from my home server or use a VPN for work.

Parking was inconvenient at best - a lot of the parking lot is taken up by construction equipment and such.  Their lot is very strangely laid out.

There is one specific brand/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot.

Rachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate.

2016,w1zNyYMp9IsqWwOrQF04hg,"First visit here! I ordered the signature Kanji ramen, donburi, gyoza, and pork belly buns.

First off, the ramen: I always compare new places to Michi since that's my top ramen place as of right now. The broth was flavorful, but thinner than the broth at Michi. The noodles were softer as well, and I prefer slightly chewy noodles. The meat was not very good, like fatty, tough pork belly. Definitely won't be coming here for ramen again.

As for the other stuff, the gyoza was nice and crispy and the donburi was good tasting but a small portion. The pork belly in the buns was the same fatty/tough, bland meat from the ramen, so I was not impressed. 

Overall, ok place, but not impressive.",3.0

The menu sounded appealing, but did not deliver on taste, portion size, or overall appeal. The thought of the food actually makes me a little nauseated. The bacon was severely undercooked, honestly it was hardly recognizable as bacon. It was a big pile of curled up, soggy, fatty meat. The coffee was the worst coffee I've ever had. I'm not a picky coffee drinker, but I was only able to choke down one sip. My cousin ordered the soft scrambled eggs with mushrooms. He took one bite and left the rest because it was such an unappealing pile of snotty looking eggs. He is a 20 something year old guy who will eat literally anything, so the rest of us at the table had to take a bite to see what was so terrible about it. The truffle flavor was over the top and the texture of the scrambled eggs was gross. One positive note was that our server was very kind.",1.0

After paying, they told me that there was only one veggie burger left, which obviously became my wife's.  After going through the line again to figure out what I wanted I ordered a veggie sandwich and a tofu skewer - and had to pay an extra 2 dollars.  I don't usually need something for free, but at this point my family was waiting at the table wondering where I was - maybe just comping me the difference at this point would have been appropriate? The veggie sandwich was thin, filled with dry wilty field greens and julienned carrots. No slices of avocado, and the bread was basic orowheat. The tofu was very dry and underwhelming compared to the skewer in Seattle (which was awesome.) About 6 off duty employees hung at a table and gossiped and sang to music, which was fine but maybe there could be another employee at another register to expedite things?

When  my son and I dropped off his car this morning to have the tires replaced and the oil changed, service advisor CHRIS  asked if he could take advantage of my son not needing the car back right away. My son, who is 18, said ""no rush.""I, on the other hand, said, ""We need to pack tonight because you're leaving for college tomorrow morning"". It is now 4:50 PM,  CHRIS just called my son and said the car would be ready by 7 PM. I was standing closer to CHRIS than my son was when I said ""We have to pack tonight, you're leaving for school tomorrow"". I don't know what part of that CHRIS did not understand.  When I called CHRIS back, and asked him why it was 7 PM, if he thought that was really reasonable, he said, ""Well, your son said..."", Completely ignoring what I told him. I asked CHRIS if he had college-age children, which he said, ""No."" I asked him if he thought It was reasonable to start packing at 7:30 at night when we got home from picking up  my son's car. He just kept going back to ""Your son said it was no rush"".  I am a reasonable person. We dropped the car off at 8:15 AM, I thought 3 PM would be great, 5 PM would be reasonable. 7 PM IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. I didn't even realize Firestone was open till 7 PM. 

 I honestly don't know why my family keeps going back to Firestone. When we had my daughter's tires put on a few years back, they were bouncing all over the road and the service advisor at that time, told me it was because the steel rims were bent. I said it was because there was 5 to 7 weights on each tire.  It was the 5 to 7 weights. Once we had the tires replaced and re-balanced, We never had a problem with her car again.

When I went in for oil changes, they just didn't rotate the tires when I asked them to. And then when my tires got worn, they said, ""We can't rotate them, we can only replace them now.""

When I was shopping for tires to replace the ones that were not rotated, Firestone's quote for four new tires for my car were more expensive than the dealership.  Everyone knows the dealership is the most expensive.

First off, it was the FIFA World Cup. Guess what, you will need more staff than usual. Your frustration with the lack of staff shouldn't be reflected on your employees. The servers were great, but their manager -- not at all.
Secondly, because of the lack of staff, there was a long queue with people waiting WHILE the world cup has already started. There were plenty of tables available, but not enough staff to take care of everything. When our turn to be seated finally came and the hostess/waitress was ready to take us to our table, the manager abruptly interrupted her, completely ignoring the fact that she was taking care of her clients. He didn't even apologize.
Thirdly, there was no sound from the TVs outside. Dude, get a grip, it is the world cup. You should have done something about it beforehand. Our poor waiter was doing everything he could to help with the issue. But with a manager like that, nobody can really help.
Fourthly, the tables outside were not put in a position where you could watch the TV. I moved my chair to be able to watch, and again, the manager, without any apologies whatsoever, passed by my chair almost pushing me off it.

2064,CJJfeYJ4kakehxVxT78iVg,"Honestly disappointed in the entire experience today. This is my first time at this location but not to macaroni grill. 

We decided on this a little bit later so it was an off peak time (around 1pm). The first impression was walking in to no one at the host stand or anyone else around. The bartender called out after a few minutes of just standing there looking around that someone will help us ""soon"". Eventually a woman who I could have assumed was the manager as she was dressed differently sat us. 

We opened the menus to disgusting menus that have clearly not been cleaned, looked up and saw air vents and the ceiling to be completely covered in Black from not cleaning at all. So that seems to not be a priority for closing or they don't really care. 

Our server took well over 5 min (closer to 10) to address our table and get us our drinks. It took so long between each visit by our server that we ate the entire bread before he could get drinks. He served one person her drinks but not the other 2 and upon asking for them ran back to get them. No one was ever checking on us and making us feel important. The server would check on the table next to us but not even turn around to ask if we were ok. Our drinks never got refilled. One of our group did the create your own pasta dish and 20 minutes AFTER we placed the order is when she got notified that they didn't have the pasta she ordered. TWENTY MINUTES!! When my ravioli dish came out the edges were dry and burnt. The whole experience was about 1.25 hours long (when there was only 2-3 other parties in the entire restaurant).  


The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the garlic cream sauce was really good and they had good $2 mimosas.

Cons:
Management staff seems to be unable to comprehend complex issues. They do not pay attention to detail, overlook important information, and lose track of almost everything. Make sure you get everything in writing & be prepared to follow up. Frequently.

The brocolini, ragu and toast was good bite when everything was combined, but as individual components, might be one of the most odd trio of items. I think I would prefer this dish pre-assembled to make sure the customer gets the memo on how it's supposed to be eaten. Eating the brocolini alone was horrible and lacking all flavor. Eating the ragu alone made me wonder where the pasta might be, and eating the toast alone made me think, there must be more. 

Who the F_ck is David Chang? Winner of the best dish name award by a long shot. The flavors are all there, but a bit heavy on the mayo sauce for me making everything very slippery in the bun. Also, the bun was well made, light and fluffy. 

The shiso leaf wrapped ""tacos"" were interesting, but should have been wrapped with a different leafy green instead. The texture of the shiso is a bit waxy and not that enjoyable. I wanted a crisp crunch of some lettuce.

The food/portions was very average and very expensive for the quality/portion size. The bread/olive oil was delicious, the bruschetta was passable (bread was delicious but the tomato topping was stone cold). Our main courses were barely hot, which was a big disappointment after waiting so long.

The waiter was overworked (having been a waiter, it is difficult work, and it wasn't his fault) but he made no attempt to communicate with us and was barely apologetic--and did not offer us a complimentary anything. I could see that the table next to us must have complained more vociferously, as they received a credit.

We understand that kitchens get backed up, but it's the responsibility of the restaurant to make it right. At the end of the evening, we attempted to talk with the manager, who made himself/herself scarce. To spend $60 (for 3 people, including a kid's meal) for such an experience is, to say the least, disappointing and frustrating.

Wings: Good wings.  I ordered them extra hot and they weren't particularly spicy, but they were cooked well and were meaty without being weird godzilla mutant chicken size.

Pizza: So, I have a love-hate relationship with the pizza.  I ordered a large garlic, pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.  It's super floppy pizza so you need two hands to eat a slice.

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.

We started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ

I was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg

As for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ

My buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.

*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.",4.0

Went there this evening for a private party.  The restaurant was great in hosting us and we had 4-5 dedicated servers.  The only drawback was the servers hadn't decided how to split the room prior to our arrival, so it was 4-5 servers running around the room taking orders with no rhyme or reason.   At the end of the function, it was chaos as people were trying to leave and the servers were trying to match up the checks to people...  crazy times!

Anyways, the food:

Nothing that I was going to eat... save the shrimp cocktail.  6 medium sized shrimp in an artsy-fartsy presentation on a rectangular plate.  It was good, the shrimp were fresh but at $1.33 per shrimp, I'll skip it the next time.

2101,yxJCdGnWj0DyCZnnAX8lWw,"The JFK Presidential Library & Museum is a great for reliving the highlights of Kennedy's presidency. However, it isn't nearly as comprehensive as other presidential museums. 

The museum begins with the 1960 convention and election season. There are some cool signs and television footage from the campaign. You can even read the original text of his inauguration speech. From there, the museum becomes a random collection of letters and gifts the Kennedys received while in the White House. The assassination is glossed over with news footage announcing his death, and the remainder of the museum is dedicated to Kennedy's legacy.

Given the Kennedy legacy, I expected more stories and items. There was very little mentioning of JFK's childhood, his relationship with Jackie, his children, or his Congressional career. Nothing negative about Kennedy was on display, which is unusual for a presidential museum. At both the Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford museums, the good and the bad are addressed.

2110,uiRig9ThFSBIQ4MaEQpRhw,"I left The Gallows feeling confused.  I really wanted to love it - I love the concept, and was drooling over the menu online.  But I left kind of feeling like I had been on a first date with a guy who seemed amazing but who talked about boring things and sent me mixed signals all night, then texted to say that he had a great time...but in lolcat...with a sad emoticon. Flummoxing, methinks.

I think a bullet list will be best to discuss my mixed impressions.  Let's start with the good:

- Love the atmosphere!  Nice lighting, perfect blend of my beloved modern-yet-cozy decorating scheme.

-Most of the food I tried was amazing...most. (see below)  My fish entree was lovely, as was the farmer's platter, which consisted of cheeses and chutneys and such, with ample bread, how novel!

-Great cocktails ('the killer' was a lovely bourbon smash) and an interesting wine list that actually suggested pairings with the specials

-Tiny complimentary ice cream cones at the end of the meal - sigh.

Okay, unfortunately here is the bad:

- Our waiter was bonkers.  I don't know if he was new and super nervous or what, but he did a variety of little and big things I didn't like, including interrupting us and leaving when only half of us had ordered dinner (wtf?); just assuming that we only wanted the tiny ice cream cones for dessert when we asked about them and jetting away only to bring them back with our CHECK, instead of telling us about that unholy bananas foster thing; letting us order pickles when a full serving of them was already included in the Longshoreman's platter which we ordered at the same time; not really knowing anything about the wine other than it was ""good"", and genuinely seeming to kind of hate us.  Sorry dude if you're reading this and it was your first day....umm...

- My husband's ""beef stew"" contained almost no beef.  But it did contain a giant hunk of fat that looked like a cube of beef, that I had the honor of accidentally eating when I tried a bit - YUM!  Come on people.  I'm sure this was a fluke but seriously.  His cocktail was also mostly ice, which was odd because it was the same as mine, and made at the same time, and mine was excellent.

- The poutine was yummy and salty but nothing like authentic poutine...which is fine I guess, because maybe they're not going for authenticity.  But the fact that the cheese seemed more like fresh cotija cheese than melty cheese curds was a major bummer.

So I guess that's it.  Maybe I'm being too critical but I hate being disappointed, and I had super high hopes for this place.  Overall I guess it leaned a bit more toward positive (hence the 3 stars) - It was just a confusing experience.  I will probably be back though, just to try that crazy bananas foster disaster of a dessert, which is still haunting me.",3.0

When I moved out to HWY 71 I was super excited to see another location close by. I went tonight, and I was very let down.

I went with my fiance and his brother, and we all shared a table number. I paid my $21 for eggplant parmigina and Merlot and waited for my food. My fiance's brother's food came quickly, shortly followed by my fiance's. I figured my food would be there soon, no biggie. I was wrong. Bread wasn't even available to me until 20 min after sitting down. The boys shared their food with me and we continued waiting. When they finally brought my food, after I had watched people seated way after us receive their food, the server tried to not even acknowledge that it was extremely late. I had to point out the fact that the rest of my party had already finished eating. He apologized, took the food away, and took it off my bill. 

I was never approached by a manager, and I never ate dinner. My fiance and his brother had delicious food, the bread was overbaked, and I am hoping that it is better when I try again. If it is, I'll update this review. It may be worth the drive to go to another location.",2.0

The add-ins are a bit meager and the egg was completely hard boiled.

I also took half of mine to go (I have a tiny stomach), and the broth/meat/noodle mixture turned into this thoroughly solid gelatinous chunk overnight. It was so icky that I just threw it out.

The add-ins are really basic, the tables aren't especially clean, and you're under a lot of pressure to eat quickly and get out. Also - a big pet peeve is that it's cash only, but it's not posted ANYWHERE. Not on the website, not on the menu, not on the walls; really, I scoured the place. It seemed almost like a cash only when I walked in, but I didn't ask when I sat down, partly because there's one server and they were rushing around but also because usually, it's posted somewhere!

I really think that Boston could use a top notch ramen place that really takes the time to make their noodles right (or at least source them better). In the meantime, I'll stick with Totto.

I called the manufacturer and they explained to me the issue with needing UV rays, noting that's only with the 'brilliant white'.  Red (which I also bought) and others are fine in darker locations.  The fellow at Phillips told me after the fact that it's all oil based paints that need sun or they turn.

I went to Barcelona Wine Bar tonight with a large party (12 people) and when it came time to settle the bill, we divided it by what we ordered. We are all working women and could not split the check evenly because many of us only got drinks (myself included). 

Our waitress was very put out that we were not hurrying the bill to her to be charged. Granted....we were a large party, and we were her last table...but we were calculating the money to charge per card (we did not ask her to do the math as we knew that would be too much to ask). 

She came back to our table at least 5 times to hover over us if we were done. It was uncomfortable and we were hurrying the best we could. She was even put off that we were doing the check this way when we told her. 

I had only order 1 glass of red sangria and was over charged what I put down (over $10). Needless to say I will not be going back to this establishment. I understand that does not mean much to a large chain and restaurant like this and I'd never thought I'd be this person writing that ""yelp review"" but if you have a large party coming to this place be sure that one person is paying or you won't be assisted properly at all.",2.0

2132,LjifuPSBGMbQ3ynk-doavA,"Car tint was installed by Sunbusters.  Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job.  To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating.

I'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me.  I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews.  I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think.  Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time.

2133,7MDAofpNMlrt5B4pOEDugA,"I echo many of the previous reviews.  First, be very careful to review the ""professional design"" they put together for you.  We had 24"" sections that the salesperson filled with 21"" cabinets and a 3"" spacer which look VERY odd.  In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right.  instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact.  And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions.  The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible.

Second, they do not call back.  If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will.  It will be a one-way street of communication.  Guaranteed.  I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening.  Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work.  Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise.  Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it.  Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. 

You are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box.  You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc.  Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week?  6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice.

Perhaps give the taco lover a new spin or twist on something they already love!
That's what Yummi Tacos attempts to accomplish with the ""Asian Fusion"" concept of Mexican and Asian....but FAILS DISASTROUSLY!
The fusion theme is ""spotty"", the attempt and intent is there, the execution lacks in so many ways.
YT tries to take the content of a Banh Mi - or Vietnamese sandwich (see my review on Baguette house) and Bulgogi (Korean BBQ), and blends it with Mexican flair. Except it's universally inconsistent! 
Tom B had told me it was open last Monday (Day 1), but I thought I'd let the new restaurant owners get settled and give them sometime to work out any kinks. I couldn't wait longer than a week. I came in on Saturday, the restaurant decor was still very sparse - empty refrigerators, make shift sauce station (soy sauce & siraracha), bare walls ....all unappealing first impression. 
I ordered one of every Taco - the bulgogi, lemongrass chicken, fish taco and fried shrimp rolls.  In speaking with one of the owners, I was told the Banh Mi had the same content as the taco, except in a ""miniature"" baguette. I say miniature because it is half the size of those found at any good Vietnamese sandwiches in town. At a whopping $3.50, I didn't think it was worth the try. Taco's are $2.00 each. 

The descriptor - marinated meats with asian slaw. Okay, kind of like the Korean bbq or the contents of a good Banh Mi inside a taco, I was excited!  
Except, there was no Asian slaw to be found...NO ASIAN SLAW !...Absolutely unforgivable! That's what makes a good Vietnamese sandwich - the pickled daikon/carrots lending the tart, sweet punch to complement the meat!  Nope, all there was was just some onions and a lot of cilantro all wrapped in a corn tortilla (no option on the type of tortilla, btw). 

Bulgogi was mediocre, the lemongrass chicken was bland and gave me only a glimpse of lemongrass, the fish taco - NOTHING special. I was blown away. With the idea of fusion, I was hoping for a freakin' party in my mouth! Flavor bursts were nowhere to be found. I was deflated to say the least. 
I concocted my own sauce at home mixing the spicy mayo I had requested from them with some more sriracha to spice things up. 
The fried shrimp rolls were essentially a shrimp with tail on, green scallion in an egg roll wrap - over fried, and disappointing.

Suggestions to YT:
Rethink the sauces - either Vietnamese or Korean - and kick up the sauces a notch - offer a Vietnamese sauce or Korean spicy bean paste or something, anything that can compete with Tacodeli's dona sauce. If you make it, they will come!
Create an Asian salsa to punch up the flavor and follow through with your description - I want SLAW!!! 
Reconsider the price of the Banh Mi- right now, you're offering your customers the same thing in a smaller size baguette for $1.50 more. Austinites are too intelligent and too versed in the way of foods to accept that. 

I wish YT only the best in their business venture, but they've got a long ways to go. I'm hoping the above suggestions are considered and I'll wait a little longer to see if any changes are made and give them another shot  in a few months. It's not worth the drive north for what they are currently offering.

For, now, if I want Banh Mi - I'm still hitting up Baguette house (their bbq pork and chicken sandwiches are unbeatable) and if I want good fish taco - I'm sticking to Tacodeli - they actually have slaw and amazing sauce - it might not be Asian, but it's there and it's fantastic!",2.0

I ordered 4 portions of chips & got very delicious crisps. (Potato chips) we explained to the girl at the counter that we expected chips that come with fish, not fries. I guess we should have clarified but being in a fish n chip shop in a concentrated Brit tourist area I didn't think I needed to lol

Anyways we paid for an additional 2 portions on ""fries"" & waited again. 2 more boxes came out with battered fries. Wasn't expecting that & although we just wanted plain old chip shop chips we did still enjoy. 

So I suggest trying the garlic & Parmesan POTATO CHIPS & hopefully the staff can learn to double check what people mean lol",3.0

I ordered scampi shrimp and scallops for an entree. The scampi was good. It was not over/under cooked at all. The dish was what you would expect from scampi.

It's spacious and can easily host large groups with separate tables.  There's nice LCD Tv's all around the restaurant and it was a nice place to hang out and try different menu items during winter olympics and world cup soccer.

I enjoy their appy items like nachos, sweet potato fries and calamari, was especially great when paired with beer and world cup soccer game at the time.  My favorite entrees are their angel hair pasta with prawns, coconut curry vegetables and the prime rib burger with garlic fries.

The food was seasoned well especially green beans and the catfish. I wish there would have been shrimp on the line. However, I tried the smothered porkchop and it had more bones than meat.The lighting was bad, there was only one person serving the buffet at the time I went thru.  The buffet table did not appear to be on to keep the food warm so my food ranged from warm to luke warm. They kept running out of food and there was a wait for things like fried chicken and cornbread so I never got to try those. Thought dessert came with the buffet  but couldn't tell if there was any on the line. Lastly, i saw one of the ladies wash tongs in a hand wash sink near the buffet that already had a plate in it.

2164,FeYAwWXudEAnVYXlQcZ4aQ,"This is the location my partner and I got our tuxedo cat named Shadow from- I have to say that there's a lot I don't like about this location, but once my partner found our future cat here, I knew that this was going to be our PetSmart from now on whether I liked it or not.

I'll start off by saying that I'm a cat person plain and simple. I've had plenty of cats in my time from kittens to elderly so I know my way around cats and how to care for them. The funny thing is that we walked into the store looking to buy fish for my partner, but me being a cat person and my partner being an animal lover, we decided to get a cat instead.

Some of the employees seemed better prepared for us to adopt our little Shadow from here than others, and the ones that seemed knowledgeable on how to handle the situation were the ones shelving or at the register. The duty of instructing us on our cat's adoption then fell to an employee that was incredibly shy and soft-spoken. He let us handle each of the cats for us to find the right fit which I was thankful for, but when I asked him about each of the cats he said he only really knew what was on their cards and not the cats themselves as individuals.

I had my heart set on finding an orange tabby or calico, but their selection was limited to other cats which was more of what my partner wanted- hence the reason why we adopted our tuxedo cat Shadow.
My apartment wasn't cat-ready so much as fish-ready at the time of adoption, so I asked if we could reserve our cat for adoption (I've done this adopting cats at other PetSmart locations in Texas) so that I could get the place ready for a cat- the entire time this employee is communicating via headset to the knowledgeable female employee that had greeted us who was busy shelving near the fish. He says that this location is unable to put an adoption on hold/make a reservation, and my partner is already too set on adopting the cat today anyway (despite never caring for a cat before or understanding the work that goes into it). 

Once we started filling out our paperwork to adopt our cat, the man gave us a bunch of coupons to get us started on getting all the supplies we needed which I was really happy about. I ask him where to find cat carriers to transport our cat to the car and he seemed really unsure and just pointed us to the cat area before walking off.

So aside from my experience with that particular employee, and then with the employees in the grooming department (long story short our cat's fur was a mess so I wanted them to at the very least shampoo it clean again) which also weren't very helpful, I like this location's Banfield Pet Hospital which has been very helpful to us, but that's about it.",3.0

1) a ""house"" size ie, a for- here order costs just as much as a large/ medium to-go order and is half the size. That is neither helpful to the environment or the regulars- if you're ordering for here it should AT LEAST be the same size as the to-go, if not bigger!! (That may be my personal opinion, but $5.00 for a shot glass of iced chai really pissed me off)

2) the baristas here are the grumpiest I've ever seen, they act like they're doing me a HUGE personal favor just by taking my debit card, and most of the time they are on their phones doing nothing (I don't come in during rush).

There were 40 people lined up along the small front waiting area of the joint shooting daggers at those that were already sitting and enjoying their food. The looks were those of desperation and hunger, coupled with a few who looked like they were dragged there by their wives and girlfriends because it's new and cool and would rather have said screw it and headed to Neuvo Laredo just around the corner.

The Piegon got the Butcher's Cut and I got the Flip Burger; we split the Onion rings. The burgers were exceptional and I liked the fact that they were not too big (5.5 oz), because when I left I didn't feel like throwing up or taking a diabetic nap like I do when I eat at George's or the Vortex. 

We actually had enough energy to head over to IKEA and pickup some picture frames. Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant. The white walls and modern red plastic chairs look like something from A Clockwork Orange.

Traditionally, Nepali food is less intense in terms of spices and sweetness. A lot of ""Nepali"" restaurants actually try to imitate Indian food to cater to a larger clientele. Honestly, I believe this is where most Nepali restaurants fail to deliver. 

Tibetan/Himalayan,  Newari,  Indian/Madeshi  alongwith regional fares (I would be hard press to express this entirely) is what makes Nepali food. The curries, dumplings and noodles are all there, but they are different. This restaurant does it the best in Boston area.",5.0

You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. 

The only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) 

Boston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can.

2203,QRPQCpvPOpaSSD1PGXtgKQ,"My wife had previously been here for dinner and last night I was able to visit for the first time.  We arrived a little later in the evening and there was barely a line.  I grabbed a menu and considered the obligatory fried chicken until I saw the Smothered Pork Chops behind the sneeze guard.  I ordered them with a side of ""Hoppin' John"" (a mixture of various beans and stewed tomatoes), french fries, and hush puppies.  I also added a dessert; the mini banana creme pie.  The pork chop from my entree was HUGE, bone-in and served on a bed of white rice.  I ordered the ""Generous"" portion that included the 3 side-items (instead of 2 for the ""Plenty"" portion) and cornbread.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  We paid and went to sit down in the family-style seating area.  Apparently when really busy it's encouraged to share tables with your neighbors.  I dove right in to the Hoppin' John; it was not what I was expecting... It was bland, with the textures and ingredients I was expecting something different I guess.  Then onto the pork chop - it was ""smothered"" in a thick mushroom gravy; the first bite was underwhelming and also unexpectedly un-flavorful.  These dishes lacked the ""Soul"" in Soul Food/Southern cuisine.  The french fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The Hush Puppies were in one word - PHENOMENAL.  Arguably the best I've ever had, fried perfectly, freshly made and extremely delicious.  Now onto the cornbread... At first glance it looks good, but once you pick it up and realize how heavy and dense with grease it is; it becomes very unappetizing very quickly.  I could only take one bite before putting it down and never returning for another taste.  It was the size and weight of a yellow grease-soaked hockey puck.  The mini banana creme pie was delicious and dense with real banana flavor. 

I would return to try other menu items.",3.0

The Tom Yum Soup comes in a hot pot...its tangy and just the right amount of sweetness. Love it! We also had the the Goat Yellow Curry...the sauce is yummilcious but the duck meat was a bit chewy. I recommend sticking with chicken meat. The boneless fried fish with tamarind sauce is something to also try.

2206,KBBbY9WdKYO_zvXeRxjNKA,"I think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it.  The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.

The service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.

Anyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",1.0
2207,05kYE04D7IEMdSlgWKDhTA,"I feel it is my civic duty to deter you from eating here. How serious am I? I made an account just to write this review, so.....

I went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept: grilled cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread! Delightful.

We walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be. There were all these crayon-scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter, so automatically I'm like, oh, this is one of THOSE places. Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. 

As I was getting my tea, I noticed the strange, vague smell of bad eggs. I thought this was due to the fountain station's proximity to the trash can. I was incorrect. I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I couldn't quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. 

I went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy-haired slacker employee. I told him he should smell my drink. He said, ""No, I'm good. I'll check on it, though."" He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, I'd be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.

The sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches. They're more like panini sandwiches, made in a big flat press. They're greasy, the bread doesn't adhere to the cheese, and they're mediocre in flavor at best. You could make a better sandwich at home for much less.",1.0

The orange juice was watery and had no pulp at all. It tasted more like orange drink and seemed to have an aftertaste. Definitely not something fresh squeezed. It was sweet and not good. We both pushed them aside. 

The Chilaquiles sounded like the egg was on a tortilla, but instead was in a bowl with tortilla chips. It wasn't what either of us expected. Not bad, but not great. I think the menu stating the egg is on chips would help.

2216,zdPkKh6pGnNEH21AeiKBqg,"Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.

Decor works.  You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)

My first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.

Other lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.

The good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.

On top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.

If I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.",3.0

Yea the rooms are a little small, but for the price it definitely cannot be beat. 
Disney staff is so friendly and smiley and polite. They help you with any questions you have. The resort has THREE pools in funky shapes. Open pingpong table next to the pool. Tons of sunning chairs. Larger than life statues of classic favs from each decade; I stayed in one of the '60s buildings right next to the Hippy Dippy pool. The arcade inside the main building was jam packed, filled with  addictive games. And they give tickets that you can trade in for prizes. Free shuttle buses to ALL Disney parks + Downtown Disney makes life so much more convenient. and we got Magical Express for staying at a Disney resort aka a big bus picked us up from the airport, dropped us off at Pop, and our luggage was automatically delivered to our room for freeeeee.

Food court has simple selections: burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc. Overpriced, but not obscenely overpriced. The best part are the three stations for drink refills: basically unlimited soda, coffee, slurpees, hot chocolate if you have a Disney cup. 

The notgreat part was the keycard demagnetization. It happened so often and it sucks. We would walk all the way back to our rooms to be denied access. Then have to walk back to the main building to get it remagnetized. At least the staff was quick and apologetic. Made us feel a little less annoyed of the situation.
and I also kind of felt trapped inside Disney's world. Made it a challenge to get OUT of the Disney area without a car. We learned to catch Lynx buses at the ticket&transportation center.

You are welcome! 

Update: I have recently spoken with people who complain about the service and how everyone is rude. I simply don't see it. I eat here probably 3-4 times a month and half dine in and half carry out. I have never had a bad experience with service. Perhaps some people are asking too much of a pizza joint? If they are looking for some fine dinning experience they can walk down the street to Harvest.",5.0

I would definitely come back based on the quality of ice cream, however the organization and service was terrible!! First off there are no prices listed anywhere that I could see. The menu board only displays the names of the flavors but no descriptions. They also apparently have coffee drinks but there was no menu or prices for this. The shop also has a very poor layout so the line takes way longer than a similar line at salt & straw would take. While the ice cream was delicious, I probably will not be coming back due to the environment of the shop.",3.0

It's in the Pearl which is the hot spot in Portland-I was looking forward to it. That is I was...until I sat down. We were ignored by the wait staff for about 20 minutes. They made up for it by bringing us complimentary glasses of sparking rose.  There's a fondue dish that's supposed to be amazing on their bar menu-we wanted it as an appetizer, and we were told that the chef doesn't serve any of the bar menu in the main part of the restaurant....what? When we pressed the waiter he said (verbatim)...""When you become a 5 star chef and open a 5 million dollar restaurant, then you can choose to serve what you want. But until that happens-this is how we do it here.""
Had I not been an invited guest, I would have walked out of there without a glance back-instead...I ordered dinner. The food was alright-not ""5 star"" but it was good. The prices were way too high, there wasn't an entree on the menu that wasn't under $30.

2236,pFwl1QOBY6hIMESM7Er-Sg,"BE SURE TO READ ENTIRE POST!!!  For years, the guys at April Realty/Aero Lawn Maintenance have occasionally mowed and trimmed my yard, a huge 7 acre mini-ranch in south Austin.  Even though they mow it infrequently, I'm always amazed that they remember from year to year all the little details. They do an excellent job, show up on time,  are friendly and courteous, and charge a fair price.  I can only afford to have them do it 3 or 4 times a year and I do the rest.   

While they were mowing my yard a few weeks ago, a member of the crew accidentally hit my Toyota truck and put a fair-sized dent in the left front fender.  I didn't see him do it, and without an eyewitness I thought,  'Oh crap, this won't turn out well'. 

Nervously, I called the owner, fearing that I might encounter the sort of denial and resistance we all run into all too often these days.  But what I got instead was what we all would like to find in such a situation: accountability.

The owner never hesitated to take responsibility.  His name is David, and I've met him a few times over the years.  And the way he handled what happened is the way every business owner should handle such situations.

The next day, I received a call from his insurance company, two days later an adjustor came out,  and within a week, I received a check for the damage.

That's how things are supposed to work.  That's called integrity, honesty, serving the customer.  And even though it's a little thing, it's the sort of thing that helps, even slightly, to restore your faith in people. And because it's become such a rare thing today, I wanted to point it out and say ""Thank You"".    

Finally, we've gotten some rain and my grass is growing again.  In fact, I just noticed it's looking a little shaggy.  And thanks to David and the guys at April Realty, I know exactly who to call.",5.0

- spare ribs
- deep fried little fish (bak fan yu - translated I think it means ""white rice fish""?)

While still a restaurant I very much enjoy, it is starting to diminish somewhat in my books.  I've been here for brunch quite a few times recently and maybe it's the brunch service that pulling down the rating for me.  

Food 4/5: Still pretty solid compared to other restaurants I dine at.  Love the dinners here, but brunch is starting to get slightly less exciting.  Maybe it's the somewhat limited selection on the menu.  Espresso is weak.   Tried the duck fat fried donuts that are all the hype right now, both the bacon topped ""When Sticky Pigs Fly"" and the honey hazelnut ""Nutty Duckers"".  Both were okay.  Warm, freshly made, but maybe too much hype.  To be honest, I was underwhelmed.  The donuts were rather flavourless and the toppings didn't add quite enough punch.

Value 3/5: Some of the brunch portions are on the smaller side.

I've used their service for five years, and I've never had a problem until this year. So I went to H&R's website, called their online number (basically useless), and then decided to make a one hour appointment at one of their branches. Things to know about this H&R Block location:

PARKING: The lot, which is shared with other businesses in the strip mall, is absolutely tiny. So finding a spot during peak hours might be difficult. The traffic in this part of Buckhead is terrible, too. 

SCHEDULING: Even though you might be able to grab a walk-in spot, it's better to make an appointment on the H&R Block website. Super easy.

WAITING: You'll likely wait five-ten plus minutes. There are a few chairs in the waiting room and complimentary coffee. You might also listen to the receptionist and other staff members unprofessionally gossip.

SERVICE: After waiting fifteen minutes or so past my appointment time, I met with a very nice gentleman in his cubicle. I really didn't like the fact that they don't have rooms and only cubicles, because it feels uncomfortable discussing personal financial information out loud when people in the lobby can easily hear. (There's no music playing or anything, too.) 

The man that worked with me basically said that he couldn't help me because he didn't understand my W-2s. He also couldn't even offer a solution, for me. Instead, I had to pitch them to him, and he just agreed with whatever I said (and seemed to just want me gone). 

So, basically, I wasted about an hour of and a half of my time visiting this place. For next year, I plan to hire an accountant.

I had a $20 bill (which was technically not mine but my roommate's), four $1s, and a debit card. Unbelievably, I got my dinner for exatcly $4.

The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.

The pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. 

I believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) 

My only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.

The location is pretty nice. Brookline is very nice and fancy and despite not having a parking lot, there was a good amount of street parking to spare. 

The actually restaurant was small.  Very small. I was quite surprised how small it was really. But when everyone spread out to all the available tables, there was enough room for you to make your delicious sushi creations.

This is only an exception for this particular class, but because there was a party that reserved the time spot after our class. Our class ended up being extremely over booked. It says online that the maximum is about 12 people. I think we had about 23.
So this very small room because CRAMPED.

I went with my boyfriend an another couple. And we had to wait a while to get to the bar in order to get out ingredients. Then we were stuck in a  spot behind the counter, in the corner without a knife to cut our sushi.

There were a lot of ingredients. Crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, salmon, smoked salmon, regular tuna. It was a lot to work with, which was a lot of fun. I don't know much about Sushi though, so I was always wondering 'will this taste good together??'  So I wish they gave out a paper wither what some sushi has in it to mimic. 

We ended up making about 4 rolls each because we were the only people not able to cut our Sushi and eat it like all the others.

The teacher was VERY nice and funny and I'm not sure if it was his wife that was helping or not, but she was very nice and fun too. 

We took the C1 beginner's class and in the beginning we were given a sheet on how to make the perfect rice, which was really helpful and answered a good amount of questions. 

All in all. I'd really like to go back and take a more accelerated course and just hope that the class isn't over booked that time.",4.0
2273,3vPjGQXL8Eos7CJvR3jMAQ,"I've always loved yogen fruz, but since my most recent visit (being Saturday), a friend and I were contemplating where to get a sweet treat after a fattening dinner.  I starting naming off a bunch that were available all along Robson as we were driving up.  She was intrigued with Yogen Fruz, so we parked and wandered in.  The place was getting packed.  It was easy to see why.  They jumped on that Pinkberry-Menchi-Qoola-bandwagon and had their own version of fill and pay flavours.

After sampling a bunch, I picked the pistachio, but I secretly wished I had a classic strawberry froyo.  I made the best of it, pistachio, a small squidge of coffee, mangoes, kiwi, strawberries and mochi balls and $7.80 later with an upstairs view of Robson street.  I was content.  I'm not going to lie, if I go back again, I will go for the strawberry hand blended froyo and leave the premixed to Pinkberry.",5.0

2278,DelMbDJUpB6bWnnA6QAQDg,"This place gets ""nice neighborhood restaurant"" just right, and has one of the top two or three shrimp and grits dishes I've had in Atlanta.  The warm, laid-back-but-elegant interior combines with a usually very gregarious crowd to form an easy to like environment.  

The menu is more free-spirited and personal compared to a typical southern themed New American style restaurant, a bit playful, like Ron is talking about stuff he salivates over through his menu.  There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce/gravy/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  

I've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  

The beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  

Service is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.  Rosebud is a good neighborhood restaurant and a viable options for all occasions.",4.0

I ordered cheese grits and got an equal cheese to grits ratio.  Cheese on the bottom of the bowl and grits poured on top.  I had a nice glob of cheese leftover at the end, even after I mixed it all together.  Corn beef hash was definitely out of a can, which is fine, but it tasted extremely old.  There was a gross metallic taste.  I did enjoy my pancake.  It was light, not too thick and had crispy edges from being cooked on the griddle.

2300,2UOV2P08kWY1OphhG2AnhA,"Neil England is a true ""Ink God"". I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. 

Let's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as ""a nightmare tattoo"". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as ""Naton"" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. 

I left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done,  until Neil came along....

About Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  

About Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. 

The vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. 

Go with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!

Lastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!

I look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.

Empire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.

Appetizers: Chicken Satay - Delicious! OR, go for the combination plate... I haven't been disappointed by an appetizer yet.

Entree: My favorite dishes are the Massaman Curry (of course) and the Spicy Basil Leaves.  The full size dishes are large enough to share or to take home as leftovers - I admit that I have eaten the full dish from time to time.  

Sides and such: I absolutely love the cucumber salad and I can't get enough of the cucumber water.  They offer a fried banana dessert that is absolutely amazing.

Atmosphere: Low lighting, booths and tables, huge print of the actual Siam Square, cherry blossom branches in vases, nice Thai dishware with a glass or two from IKEA :)

2325,qyOjMkxO_6J14JowHsl-_Q,"I LOVE the fried chicken wings here! 

The lady boss is very friendly and if you can speak Teochew, even better. She basically told me her life story on the premise that my mother is Teochew (though I cannot speak it much) :p So I was told this restaurant is related to Phnom Penh, that the owners are related. Hence, the similar food items on the menu.

I have only been here a few times as it is not very convenient for me to get here using transit, plus they also close fairly early. I usually come here during lunch and it is not that busy when I am there. Either people do not know of this place or this is more of a dinner place.

The pho soup is a bit different as it is light tasting, very similar to Teochew style of noodle soup. The dry egg noodle is really nice, similar to the one at Phnom Penh. The owner also let us try a dessert she made on the house - something with black glutinous rice and sugar.

She was unprofessional and insisted I call my mom while I was there to find out if her job (which is a dental surgery office) was hiring. The dentist then suggested I get a root canal, and my teeth are in no condition to need a surgery like that, so I told him I would not be doing that procedure that day. I have some sensitivity due to braces (he never asked if i had worn them) but nothing that would warrant a $1500 root canal.

This unscrupulous operation charged over $500 to rekey some locks, or $32/lock, about triple the normal $12-$14.  In addition, Avi charged both a service call and labor (normal practice is one or the other).  My associate did not catch the overcharging before swiping our company card.

I initially thought the ludicrously high amount was a billing mistake.  Avi was slow to respond to multiple calls (took a couple weeks) and his tone was belligerent.  He only became responsive when I mentioned posting a review.  He promised to come back after conferring with his ""boss,"" but that was over a week ago and no call-back.

2342,K2yhPxE1W43apFPA7Ng7Kg,"The fifth star is usually knocked off as soon as you drive by Hopdoddy and see the line is out the door. This isn't really a fault as much as a marketing success for Hopdoddy, but considering it increases the time that separates me and a juicy hot meat patty I have to consider it a negative. Also you can't really have groups come eat here, I'd consider 4 a comfortable max, otherwise your chances of getting split up increase by a lot and how are you going to explain ""bros before hoes"" to your wife before you ditch the bitch?

Once you finally get through customs though and place your order get ready for the best burger high of your life. I recommend the shroom burger exclusively, unless they happen to have an appetizing burger of the week. 
The shroom burger comes specially with pesto, portabella mushrooms, and goat cheese layered on a brioche bun. The buns are soft and buttery, perfectly baked in house. In a bite, the bun holds the package together well until you get to the real meat of the sandwich. Thick rich meat juice runs across your tongue as your salivary glands ejaculate in excitement, swathed in the creaminess of goat cheese. The nuttiness of the pesto accentuates the patty well, and the herbiness of the garlic gives a gentle bite that makes your spine shiver in anticipation of the next bite. Last but not least, the mushrooms add a good texture for a layered mouthfeel, their mellow earthiness blends well with the meat for a further enriched taste that will have you gnashing away at your burger like a crack addict looking for that next hit. Before you know it, the crack is gone and you're left staring at your tray wondering if it really happened. 

If you happened to have fasted that day and are a sweet-tooth, the milkshakes are worth the splurge. Despite the fact the nutella & pretzel shake is often poorly mixed, this just means you have a salty ball of chilled hazelnut chocolate waiting at the bottom of your shake, the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.

The fries are pretty good, but not a main attraction by any stretch of the imagination. Overall - if you're feeling like you make enough money to justify spending this much on a nice patty hit Hopdoddy up. If you're on a budget go to 
P. TERRY's for the same quality but much cheaper.",4.0

The only way to get something for free is to roll a D20 which is kinda fun in theory, but really sucked for me in reality. I rolled and got stuck with the choice I had already made at Red Castle, who's staff by the way was allowing all their patrons to simply pick their own free item, or ask them questions to help them make a selection. And my bf, rolled and got an item for a game we don't own (we were both hoping to get some new RPGs to try out and see if we liked).

I'd been to one shop before coming here and I didn't have a pleasant experience so I didn't end up getting anything done. I decided to give 10th street a try since my friend had a great experience. I called Mark on a Thurs so I could talk to him and let him know what I was interested in and to see his availibility for Friday. I told him the size and words I wanted, he said it was pretty straight forward. I also mentioned to him my trip to the beach in a little over 3 weeks and he said I'd be fine. 

After work on Friday I drove straight to 10th street. I showed Mark the pictures on my phone of the words and symbol and showed him the placement on my body. He said it was great and he could definitely do it and it wouldn't take long...like max 15 min. That was great for me because it being my first one and not knowing what to expect-- the quicker the better lol. I felt very comfortable here. 

Before he started the tattoo, I was able to see exactly where it would be and how it would look to make sure it was the exact location. I decided to move it slightly. I'm glad I was able to preview it though...being that it's permanent and all. 

Once I got in the chair I tried to relax. He told me to let him know if I needed him to stop or anything like that but reassured me I'd be okay. I'm glad someone thought I'd be okay because I wasn't sure I was going to be lol. We talked through the whole thing which caused me to be at ease. It didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought-- actually it didn't really hurt at all. A few times it was uncomfortable but just something you'd grit your teeth over. He was done before I knew it.

I'll say right off that bat- don't have the rolls. Even for the price, they are not worth it. They are obviously pre-made and refrigerated, and they're probably not what you're in the mood for anyway (you won't find anything fresh-made, nothing hot, nothing deep-fried, nothing fusion- just the basic regulars, pre-made and retrieved from the fridge when you order it). Back when I first started coming to Banzai I only ate nigiri, so I didn't know how bad the rolls were. Don't get me wrong, they won't give you food poisoning or anything- they're just not good. The nigiri, though, is decent, if a bit over-priced for the portions. It's great for a quick bite though- the service is decent and fast and the servers are friendly. I also LOVE their bento boxes- they're a really good deal and delicious, especially the salmon one. You can also get an assortment of those Japanese fad drinks, which I like because you can't get those at most other sushi places. The tonkatsu is also good- with pork the way I like it, as opposed to with chicken the way it's offered at almost every other Japanese place in Austin. The lunch specials are okay- they give me the same pre-made and thawed impression I get from the rolls, but they aren't bad tasting, although the portions are a little small.

Don't get me wrong; every time I have come here they always nail the design (pun intended) I show them, no matter how complex and they always look fantastic and just like the design I wanted. 

However, they are very aggressive (consistently) while filing my nails. It is often uncomfortable, sometimes painful, and my skin around my nails is usually red and sometimes cut.

My main reason for the two-star review is my concern of their sanitary practices. Last time I got my nails done, the nail tech used the nail file on me and immediately put it back into her box with her other supplies... you are never supposed to reuse a regular nail file on OTHER people, especially when they have a tendency to cut skin while filing which is highly likely to cause infection! Same situation with the electric file she used later; she did not sanitize or throw away the tip or anything before putting it back in her back box with people's nail dust sprinkling over her other tools.

Old Bay Crawfish: 1  1/2 lbs of whole crawfish seasoned w/ old bay. served w/ lemon $9.00 Not as flavorful as Boiling Crab, but still good.  I actually think because it wasn't drowned in spices, you can actually taste the flavor of the crawfish.  

Mixed Crab Bowl: 2lb snow crab, 1 lb dungeness crab clusters, and 1 lb king crab legs w/ drawn butter.  (all weights are prior to cooking) $84.00.  This was definitely a splurge. I was a bit hesitant because 4 lbs of crab isn't necessarily a lot and restaurants usually overcharge.  I was pleasantly surprised when the crab that came out was practically all meat.  The crabs were cooked just right, the meat was juicy and warm, and the overall digging in with our bare hands and riping up the crab was just right down our alley.  It took us a bit of time to devoure this feast so by the end legs were starting to get a bit cold.  It was still overpriced, but if I had another celebration to attend at this restaurant I would not hesitate to order this dish again with someone.  

I've been there where they have offered us a great catch, a 20lb lobster or whatever giant monstrosity they happen to catch that day.  Never partook in them, but it's interesting to know that you can if you wanted to.",3.0
2372,rwFaeUCpETab5PhiRbA3jA,"So this review is coming from a tourist who has never attended HHN previously, but was extremely excited to experience the Walking Dead and Silent Hill haunted houses as a bonus to our Disney vacation.

In short, our whole experience at HHN was disastrous. We waited in line (in the rain) for 1.5-2 hours for each haunted house, and each house takes about 3-4 minutes to walk through (not the greatest wait-time to ride-time ratio) . Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.

Universal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN. Even on a stormy night, the lines were ridiculously long, and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times.

Unless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass, I wouldn't recommend attending. Don't waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub-par haunted houses.",1.0

2374,mCbY3OsBQwk8ArCD5oiDow,"First of all I'd say they are more of a 3.5 star place for me.  We started with an amuse of a lightly smoked salmon crudo and a small butternut squash soup.  I then had foie gras 2 ways (seared and a torchon).  The torchon I think was the better of the 2 preparations although there was a string of connective tissue in it which I found a little unappetizing.  Also I felt that it could have benefited from a couple of crystals of sea salt on the top to give it a little more flavor.  My wife had the organic lettuce salad with fruits and olive oil.  It was well.... a salad nothing bad about it but I would not call it outstanding either.  I had the rack of lamb and my wife had a piece of soy glazed sable fish.  The sable fish had a nice texture.  It was kind of like a cross between cod and sea bass and it had some firmness but not as firm as cod and a slight buttery flavor to it but not as buttery as sea bass either.  I ordered my lamb chops medium rare but they came out a little closer to medium.  For dessert we both had a Grand Marnier souffle.  It's been a VERY long time since I have had a properly done souffle.  They certainly have a good example of the breed here.  Also try the Canadian ice wine here.  It is addictive.  If the torchon and the lamb had been properly executed I'd have given them 4 stars.  At this price point, you have to execute flawlessly with every dish.",3.0
2375,yt8wg-sJD1xbpfBlB3n4oQ,"I had been to Finz this summer with my brothers and had the most amazing salmon dish. I'm talking drool worthy best-meal-I've-ever-had dish. So when it came time for my 30th birthday dinner that's obviously what I wanted. I'd literally been dreaming about this salmon! If I were to base this review on that experience it'd be a 5 star, hands down.

The restaurant wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive but things came out horribly slow. We got apps and drinks and were done with our appetizers and waited at least 10-15 more minutes before our meals came out. Slow to the point where I thought maybe our meals had been forgotten about. I ordered another drink and by the time I got it I didn't want it anymore slow.

The food came out and it didn't look quite as I remembered. It didn't taste quite as I remembered. In fact, it was pretty disappointing. 

Maybe it was because they had a rehearsal dinner going on, but I was not satisfied at all.  The service was slow, the food was disappointing, the overall experience just left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). It was really too bad because I had talked this place up to everyone and I left crestfallen.",2.0
2376,dRVAyaPaFpsl_lL_3cF4PA,"I visited on February 15, 2015, the day after Valentine's Day because they were totally reserved! So, with it being such a popular choice for the weekend I anticipated a great meal. Sadly, the meal that came with a $160 price tag for two was simply OK. 

For the appetizer, I got the Lobster and Crab Cakes-pretty good. Drink, I chose a signature cocktail, Classic Manhattan, which was good and strong! My boyfriend and I both had Ceasar salads preceding our meals as well. The sides were a la carte and big enough to share. I got Lobster Mac N' Cheese and my boyfriend got Sam's Mashed Potatoes. There was entirely too much bread crumb drizzle over my mac n' cheese that I could have done without. 

Now for the entrees! You go to a steakhouse and expect the greatest steak ever.....guess again! I ordered the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream; its a 14 oz sirloin seasoned with black peppercorn for a spicy flavor. I asked for it to be prepared medium well, and the first cut was like I butchered and slaughtered it myself, bloody!!! I sent it back, it returned still too red in the center for my liking. So, before returning it again, I asked to make it well done to be on the safe side. That request was ignored, and it was brought back for the third time at the best attempt for medium well. I'm sure it lost some of its tenderness because of the back and forth attempts to cook it properly. The best thing about this steak was the seasoning and sauce drizzled over it. My boyfriend got the All-Natural Herb Roasted Chicken, which he neither raved or complained about. 

Dessert, didn't get any, they were completely out of the little joy that may have brightened up this dinner for me. I wanted the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake....welp, maybe next time when I go for a cocktail and not a steak!",3.0
2377,-9zwCakQTuINtIu3C23K1w,"I've brought my car here a few times now, and I will say that I like the service I receive, especially for my money.

The actual wash itself is great, but where Scrub-a-Sub really shines (no pun intended) is in the additional services that they provide. Having a team of three guys tackle your disgusting car at once is excellent. One goes to town on shampooing and cleaning the floor mats. Another is busy vaccuuming out french fries from Wendy's, McDonald's, AND Burger King. The third is busy cleaning the dash, windshield, and other interior panels. The cleaning goes like clockwork, and usually, it's done in about 15 minutes.

The only downside is that if you choose to have the additional services done on your car, you may end up waiting for a bit of time. They service only one car at a time, and if they're busy, you're going to wait in line for them to get to your car, and that could end up being a long wait, depending on what the other people in front of you paid for.",4.0

The technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it ""under-the-table."" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I ""refused"" the technician's offer to come back later.

My friend had the Chicken Parmigiana and I did the 3-course prix fixe for $35, starting with the Fra Diavolo. Both were insanely delicious. Huge portions, wonderfully cooked. Her chicken was meaty and juicy. My Fra Diavolo came with a generous helping of perfectly-buttered lobster, thick, fabulous spicy tomato sauce and chewy noodles. It's one of my favorite types of pasta (how can you go wrong with seafood and spicy sauce?) and Grotto's was fantastic!

Also treated myself to a Bellini, the only cocktail they serve. It had all the peach puree-y goodness one expects from the classic cocktail, though at $10, it was a tad pricey for the amount.

Service was consistently great, from the beginning where we were the first customers, to the end, when it got packed (on a Monday night!). This is the perfect date spot, friend spot, family spot....any spot!

The green tea cupcake's flavor was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry.

It was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry.

I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought ""almond"" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. 

The plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted.

The portion was less than I would expect a normal side to be with a dinner.

2411,jgGouOhDStkWWOgIvHeobA,"Came here for breakfast, but it turned into brunch/lunch due to the wait. First off, somebody tried to cut in front of me when I was waiting patiently in line. If the manager didn't happen to come by and point out to the staff that I had been waiting first, the other party would have been seated before me. Once my boyfriend and I were seated, it took a long time for the meal to come out. Our waiter had kindly apologized in advance that our service would be slower than usual because he was managing multiple tables and covering for another staff member due to issues with taking break (aka work drama). I did appreciate this early information so we knew what to expect, but the wait turned out to be ridiculous, on top of getting my boyfriend's order wrong!

I had the Sticky Bun Pancake Breakfast with sausage. I enjoyed my fluffy, sweet pancakes. My boyfriend, on the other hand, did not completely enjoy his order.  He had the Steak Skewer and Eggs Skillet, and the steak was juicy and great, but he had specifically requested the mushrooms to be on the side because he hates mushrooms and was going to give them to me. He also requested toast for an additional 99 cents (as indicated on the menu), but the toast didn't arrive until he was practically done with his meal, AND he was charged $1.99 instead because the waiter said he put in the toast as a side after he had already ordered the skillet meal. Well, if the waiter wasn't so busy, my boyfriend would have been able to request the toast sooner, but we couldn't get his attention and had no idea it would result in an additional charge than indicated on the menu until we received the receipt, which took a long time to obtain too! 

Here's what we had: 

+ Sticky Bun Pancake Breakfast: Cinnamon sauce and cream cheese icing drizzled over two buttermilk pancakes with glazed pecans cooked inside the pancakes, served with two eggs and hash browns, and choice of two strips of bacon or two sausage links ($7.99)

+ Steak Skewer and Eggs Skillet: Grilled sirloin steak atop fire-roasted bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and red-skinned potatoes, topped with a sweet bourbon sauce and two eggs ($10.29) - add toast for an additional 99 cents

Overall, the food was good, but the service was extremely slow. It's one thing to be a little slower than usual, but this was so slow that what should have been a quick, no-longer-than-an-hour meal to a two hour meal!",2.0
2412,iz89hnkkU5MXSvODiIKiaA,"There is definitely a wow factor when you enter the restaurant from the hotel.  The dim lighting and decor is very classy and chic.  Despite having a reservation and the restaurant not being very crowded, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to provide suggestions based on what my friend and I were in the mood for.  Because it was Dine Out Boston, there was a pre-fixe menu to choose courses from for $38, with several items to add for an up-charge.  We started with the tuna tartar, which was nice and fresh, although had a ""different"" flavor to it which I could not pick up on and did not love.  The quail yoke on the tuna tartar was neat, but did not provide much flavor.  We also shared the porcini flatbread, which was thin and crispy with a subtle mushroom flavor-not too overbearing.  I had the scallop entree, which came with four large, nicely seared scallops over mashed cauliflower, with roasted cauliflower, broccoli and golden raisins.  This dish was delicious and not too heavy-the waiter steered me in the right direction!  My friend had the bolognese, which was a mix of veal and oxtail, served over home-made rigatoni.  This was also delicious, with right amount of sauce over the pasta and a nice portion size.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisu with dolce de leche gelato.  It was good- but I was hoping it would be better, seeing we were in the North End.  The bottom layer was overly moist and the top layers were quite dry.  Overall, we had an enjoyable meal.

Anyway, my first experience was okay and only involved food. I got the salad and was pretty pleased with it! My friend ordered chicken and waffles and her chicken was completely raw in the center. They, of course, remade it so it wasn't too big of a deal at the time. 

The next time I went I ordered a matcha latte to go. It was okay as well, pretty tasty but not amazing. My issue though is that the person who made it was wearing gloves and prepping something for the chicken when I walked in, then took my order and made my drink without ever removing or changing her gloves which was pretty disgusting. I really didn't think much of it until I left and took a sip, at which point I realized it smelled like fried chicken and I had to wipe greasy residue off the lid for a couple minutes before I could drink it. :-| In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't get sick!

I can say that this is one of the worst medical centers in the city. Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients. Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients. 

The staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people. 

This place is a product of profits over patients. They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer. They run on a bare minimum staff (most of whom are, admittedly, underpaid- which may explain why they are all so unhappy) and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County.

I use yelp all the time and this is one of only two times when I think that a company's ratings were gained dishonestly. Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased. I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection. My friend's license is expired so he could not do the official report for me. My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find, one of them requiring major electrical repair. At my friend's urging, I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than $800 worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed. Because API did not document the electrical problems, the seller refused to reimburse that cost. In addition, the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it, he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator, that is not inluded in the inspection. I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work. So, the $400 I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money. When I asked Gary if he could at least refund me the cost of the inspection to help offset the many costs I incurred because of his company's neglect to find them, he ignored my request. Do not deal with these guys. I do not know how they have such high ratings in yelp but they are not a company to trust with such a large purchase.",1.0

When I ordered my chai, I was encouraged because they asked me if I wanted spicy or sweet. I chose the spicy chai, but what I got tasted like skim milk with vanilla and a dash of nutmeg. Apparently the Stumptown they serve didn't taste great either.

But my biggest complaint was the little care they took to make customers comfortable. I counted three fans in the store, all pointed to the counter and prep areas, rather than out to the customers.

I was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night (Mar 17), walked in close to 8:30p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened. The lights were still on at Yalla, three behind the counter, with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier. There was no sign of closing down/wrapping up/adding up receipts, etc. I asked if they were still open and she said yes. When ordering, I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it's not specified on the menu, she was curt and said chicken. I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there's no one waiting behind me. The second server (woman) gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one (now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers). There's no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering (that I can see). It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn't familiar with what they have. KSM is an open space so when it's not packed, there's echo. The girl was very soft-spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions. She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away. I actually wasn't the last customer, they took orders from two other after me.

Point of the story is, I understand that it's end of the day and you were supposed to close at 8:30p, that was why I asked if you guys were still open. The second you said yes, you had committed to deliver. If you were going to be rude and act annoyed (i'm actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it's end of day and it's not because of their personalities), then don't say yes; apologize and said you were closing, I would have come back next time I am at KSM.

A friend was visiting Boston for the weekend and we decided to walk the Freedom Trail. It was a windy New England winter day and the sky was spitting slush, but I still insisted that we walk all the way across the Charlestown Bridge because otherwise her Freedom Trail experience would not be complete!!

By the time we were walking back from the Bunker Hill monument, our coats were entirely covered with a layer of slush. We had wanted to go to the North End for dinner, but we weren't sure we'd make it that far without dropping dead from frostbite. As we approached the bridge to cross back in the other direction, we spotted the haven of Olives, with its warm, friendly lights inside. We walked to the window, looked at the menu, and were thrilled to see prices we could afford. So in we went.

We were seated by a friendly waitress who dropped off a basket of bread and dish of olive oil with herbs. It smelled heavenly. But when we opened our menus, we saw prices that were most definitely not what we had seen in the window. So, we waited. With that bread in front of us, tempting us with its irresistible aroma. For fifteen minutes, while our waitress did not come and did not come and did not come.

When she finally came back to take our order, I said, ""The prices on the menu don't seem to be the same as what was in the window."" Without a word, she turned and walked to the window. She removed the lunch menu and replaced it with the dinner menu. Then she came back to our table and explained that the lunch menu had been left up too long in error. Gesturing to the dinner menu, I said, ""These prices are really more than what we were hoping to pay."" 

Instead of saying, ""I'm sorry. You can order from the lunch menu, since it's our fault that it was left up too long,"" she said, ""That's all right, you can just go ahead and leave then."" So we did.

The first time we went, there was some matting on his tail and they gave me a call to discuss our options which I appreciated.  Each time I can't believe how quick it is. It's typically taken a half a day at other groomers, and I get a call that Walter is ready in just two hours (or less)!  Lastly,I love that he's not crated when finished and gets to run around a bit and depending on the day happily play with other pups until I arrive to pick him up.",5.0

With that said, I've dined twice recently for lunch at Proper Eats. The foremost surprise to me was how well the meal stuck with me. I thought for sure I would be hungry again by 5PM, but that was not the case. Second surprise was just how tasty everything was, especially tempeh which I don't believe I'd ever had before. Overall both meals I had were scrumptious and filling. Last time I was there, one of the employees asked me how my meal was, and this is an important sign that a restaurant takes pride in what they do. Also, I noticed the prices on their organic produce was MUCH more affordable than my local Fred Meyer, so I'm going to be doing some shopping there sometime.",4.0

My new first question to food servers is ""Where would you point me [on your menu] for lower-sodium options? The food server's answer here was ""We can ask the kitchen not to salt your meal."" I should have just had an omelet and I would have been safe. Instead, it was lunchtime, so I ordered a salmon burger. I asked them not to salt it. When it arrived, it had a seasoning salt all over it. According to the kitchen/food server ""that wasn't salt, it was seasoning."" Okay, next time I'll give more explicit instructions. Everything else about the experience was good.",3.0
2454,xuhaCCcgOBJFmzbjFGbfwQ,"Valentine's night was snowy and stormy so we assumed most people had canceled. In fact, we had called earlier that evening to confirm our 9:30pm Open Table reservation and was told they had an 8:30pm reservation available if we wanted it. We snapped it up!

Despite the bad weather, we arrived on time at 8:30pm. We knew something wasn't right when we saw about a dozen people in coats clustered around the front door. We checked in with the two frazzled hostesses who noted that they were running about 30 minutes behind ""due to weather."" They suggested we get a drink at the bar but alas that area was completely filled with people both sitting and standing. We opted to wait.

And wait we did. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we noticed three tables open up. There were still about 12 of us (6 couples) crammed together by the front door waiting to be seated. Those 3 tables remained empty for the next twenty minutes. My husband suggested that maybe they were trying to give the kitchen a chance to catch up. My response was that even if that were the case, why not sit three couples and offer them a drink or just some bread?

As we waited for our table, we could not help but notice that the two hostesses seemed completely overwhelmed... but were not seating anyone. They spent a lot of time on the phone and rearranging menus. They also seemed preoccupied with chasing departing female patrons out the door and handing out complimentary roses rather than working their way through the reservation list. 

After 50 minutes of waiting, and twenty minutes of eyeing the three empty tables. we watched the hostesses seat a couple who had arrived 10 minutes after us. I approached the hostesses, asked how long the wait would be given that we were approaching 60 minutes and was promptly seated at one of the longstanding empty tables. Another couple who had arrived at the same time as my husband and I then also approached the hostesses and were seated immediately. It made us wonder why we made a reservation at all? (I also received an email from Open Table today indicating that the Blue Ox reported that we never showed up for our reservation. So I have to ask: what exactly were the hostesses doing all night besides handing out roses?)

Despite it being obvious that there was a 50-60 minute wait to be seated despite having a reservation, none of the restaurant patrons got even an apology from the manager. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I can tell you that this is common policy when dealing with such an obvious customer service issue. (It also helps to offer a complimentary cocktail or appetizer to acknowledge the rough start. Nope, nothing of the sort.) Just a harried waitress who I felt genuinely sorry for because she seemed completely in the weeds. 

Food was quite good but service was - not unexpectedly - very slow. We skipped dessert because by the time we finished our entrees (served at 10:30pm), it was almost 11pm. Of course we tipped well... Not the fault of the server that all of this was happening. 

What a disappointment. Normally I would give fewer stars for such a bad experience but we ate here before (spring 2014) and it was delightful. So three stars to reflect one nice experience and one disaster. Not sure we will go back, though.",3.0

But then, the food itself.

The portions were good, but I was a little disappointed that the crackers it was served with were Saltines.  Meh.  No big deal.

She had the fresh grilled red snapper, which I had a few nibbles of and we both agreed that it was good, but not ""holy shit, this is the best I have ever had!""  My ribeye was good, but was an extremely fatty cut, and the dog got most of the leftovers, because he is a spoiled brat.  The most disappointing was the beignets, which was basically fried dough with a crystal sugar on them, and we all know the best beignets is made with powdered sugar.  And to add insult to a great and long loved dessert dish, they served it with this kind of white icing for dipping.  Seriously, the same crap you get with cinnamon sticks at Pizza Hut.  Not a good look, BB Kings, not good at all.

Looking at the few bad reviews on Yelp: Curra's just isn't about chips and salsa... they're not Tex-Mex... and they get SLAMMED during peak hours, so factor that in if you have a big party or are in a hurry. Otherwise...

Excellent hand-made tortillas. I often get the pork tamales for takeout. Their justly-famous avocado margarita is perfect and unlike anything you've had anywhere else. The breakfast items are very good and served all day. And sometimes I get the chicken soup, which is a BIG bowl and very good. 

The owner Jorge is almost always on site and is a great guy. He seems to know everyone. A lot of celebrities eat at Curra's. 

The food here is far better than that other fancy place in Austin that specializes in Central Mexican cuisine, with way better prices. 

Parking can be tricky when they're busy... then you have to park on the street around the corner. Tip: best bet for the best experience is to go to Curra's at an off-hour... it gets really packed at peak hours. Or at peak hours, just call in the tamales for takeout.",5.0

They have a pretty wide space, and we were put further in the back, a bit awkward since we were right next to the cash register, but nothing awful. It was however early and empty enough that I was wondering why we weren't seated elsewhere.

When I first sat down I thought the beer menu was the regular menu, it's that big. The menu for food is something that just fits on your placemat, but the beer menu has pages upon pages of drinks. The guys got beers, while I got an Ice Box which tasted more like an iced coffee than anything alcoholic, and my cousin got Peach Bellini which she also enjoyed.

Although I really enjoyed my drink I found my food average. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Breakfast Club. I loved the tater tots, those were delicious, but I found the sandwich itself kind of clunky and dry. The chicken breast wasn't heavily battered, so it tasted more like a slightly floured piece of chicken as opposed to the crunchy ""KFC style chicken"" I'd been expecting. The egg was also overcooked, although I probably should've asked for over easy. But basically there were two layers of the sandwich, or three pieces of waffle bread. I thought there would be a tomato or something else with moisture in it since the egg wasn't runny, but no. Because of this I found the sandwich very difficult to eat, I had to drench the entire thing with all of the maple syrup I was given and that still wasn't enough.

2495,0Kr3hzusJuRbAhkql9t3lw,"When you read a critical review among a sea of positive reviews, your first impression is the reviewer in question is nitpicking or simply crazy. I can assure you that I am neither. Rather I am surprised this hotel has received such strong praise. Overa6ll, I would not recommend this hotel. This does not resemble the service and quality of rooms found in the New York Waldorf among others. As one reviewer said: ""It's a Waldorf in name only"" and I agree with this. 

First, our room was hot. And not just the room, the entire hallway outside was warm as if you were standing outside. Our thermostat was deliberately set so that you could not lower it below 68 degrees. And even at 68 degrees, it felt more like it was 75 degrees. When we complained to the front desk, the technician arrived and removed this restriction so that you could set it to 62 degrees. We set the unit at 62 degrees and the unit could not go below 67 which felt like 74-75. It was clear from our standpoint, that the thermostat was clearly off and the A/C unit was not efficient. This is what I would expect from a motel and not a supposed 5 star hotel. 

Another reviewer cited a leaking shower. That was our experience as well. The caulking on the base of the shower was loose and water soaked the floor after our shower. 

Another reviewer cited the questionable size of their King bed claiming it was a Queen size bed. This was our experience as well. The bed was small and it clearly was not a King size bed in our opinion. 

Many reviewers cited the pool as being a plus. I find that hard to believe. The pools were standard square pools that can be found in any 2 or 3 star hotel. Actually, the pool at the conjoined Hilton had a much nicer pool. The Hilton pool had a lazy river with a nice long snake like shape with a beautiful layout. 

This leads me to my second point. The Hilton Bonnet Creek Resort is attached to the Waldorf Astoria (in case you were not aware of this).  The Bonnet Creek was a much nicer hotel in our opinion. It's lobby was larger and more gallant. It had a much more festive Christmas decoration and a livelier ambience. We originally booked with the Bonnet Creek, but they oversold their rooms so they moved us to the Waldorf as an ""courtesy upgrade"" We read between the lines and insisted we would prefer to stay at the Bonnet Creek but no such luck, they had no rooms left.  It was fairly obvious that most people preferred to stay at the Hilton than the Waldorf and you can understand why.  

So what was good about the hotel? The service was fantastic. Everyone was polite and friendly. The hotel is new so it is very contemporary. The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. The shower amenities were Salvatore Fergamo. A blue ray player was included in the room. The sheets smelled clean and the bed was well made.  The floors were quiet as well. The guests seem to be fairly classy and there were no loud and obnoxious people which can make a stay less enjoyable. 

In conclusion, if you are going to pay $400 dollars per night, you are better off spending that type of money at the Four Seasons, Ritz Carleton or one of the more upscale DIsney resorts like the Contemporary IMHO",2.0

So flavorful and comforting. It's like if your mom made you a nice heaping bowl full of love. The beef chunks were plentiful and not full of tendons like most places. It just falls apart when you eat it. Price wise, the noodles costed about 9 dollars, pretty dang good for what you get. 

We also ordered the beef rolls, basically the green onion pancake wrapped around some beef and hoisin sauce. Four in an order, and trust me, you will get full off of two. The green onion pancake was nice and flaky like green onion pancakes should be, so thumbs up to RiceBowl for nailing that.

They also seem to stock the recent releases from most noise, art, and indy genres. Mostly Midheaven/Revolver distro type stuff it seems.

First, I know we need increased security now, so we can feel and be safe. Universal gets it wrong however by herding the whole crowd through a woefully meager number of check points. Last night, a Sunday, not peak, that process added over 30 minutes to the getting in the park process. Then they had the ticket windows operating extra, super slow. That addes 45 minutes to the wait. So we were witing in lines about 1.5 hours, just to get in. Other than that it is the same fun. You can ride some of the rides and go into the scare houses.

This thing happened before like twice, so I talked to the server but her attitude made me freaking mad. she eventually got me a new place with chicken, but the way she spoke to me was very impolite..I think she thought I told her to get an extra free food or something.

I stopped to go there for awhile..about year and half..
I went back last time and was satisfied..

Some of the locals told me they've tried nearly all the burgers on the menu and each has been delicious. 

The Primetime Burger surely did not let me down. The ingredients tasted fresh and the flavors were just absolutely out of this world! You can really taste the difference with Hopdoddy. I had some of my friend's fries and they were good too although no where as unique in flavor as the burgers. 

I paired my burger with a Nutella & Chocolate Pretzels Shake, which was amazing as well! 

I'm not sure if the lines are usually as long as the line was when I was in town so I would recommend getting there a bit early because my friends and I had to wait in line outside, inside, and then a bit more after we ordered our deliciousness.

When I walked into the restaurant, the staff was very friendly.  The restauraunt was wide-open and spacious, as if built to handle a massive crowd.  Then I looked for the menus on the wall, and they were placed in awkward spaces -- you had to be in line to really get an idea of what the menu consisted of and what the restaurante offered.  All this aside, I made it to the front (no waiting on this Sunday afternoon) and not wanting to have standard chicken fingers, ordered one piece of their regular chicken, and one piece of their citrus chicken.  For sides I ordered fried plantains and beans.  Their regular chicken was flavorful and very moist, I thought it was definitely a big hit, and that it was better than standard KFC fare.  The citrus chicken was also moist and flavorful, but finished with a very strong salty aftertaste.  So skip the citrus chicken unless you really crave lemon/lime flavors with your chicken and don't mind the accompanying saltiness.  The plantains were fine - fresh and ripe, then perfectly cooked/fried, and with a wonderfully sweet flavor.  But the biggest hit of all (and to me the greatest surprise) were the beans.  The beans were incredibly flavorful, not overpowering, and without overuse of peppers and no hint of cilantro.  This was pure gourmet latin-style flavor and I loved them.  So folks, the BEANS make Pollo Campero worth visiting, and their regular chicken would probably satisfy the most picky eater.

Confession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. 

That said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. 

Anyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.",4.0

She refused to provide a time frame for how much longer we would need to wait, kept reminding us that we were walk-in's with a large party as if we didn't know.  She then decides to ask us how many children vs. adults there were in the party, and then seats a huge party with no children that came in after my party. The worse part is that the hostess proceeds to talk negatively about us to another employee while we are standing right there in front of her!!!  When we complained to a manager, she suddenly was willing to accommodate us immediately. So folks, this is how you get a table here: 1. wait over an hour when the hostess tells you the wait is less; 2. when you ask how much longer it's going to be, the hostess will respond unprofessionally and rudely, and won't really do anything more than that; 3. complain to a manager who will magically have a table available on the fly. Showed up at 6:30 PM, gave up at 8 PM. After all that, we just decided to leave and not even eat.",1.0

2549,FwEvDwwXpzO-scWTqfDFJw,"As a former Minnesotan, Jamba Juice was a personal part of my story.  Before going for our token Lake Calhoun or Lake Harriet walks, Sonni and I would stop at Jamba Juice and get a Razzamataz Smoothie with an energy boost.  Wow do I remember those days.

So, when I saw a Jamba Juice at the Hartsfield Airport, I was like wow, but then I said wait...

I called Sonni.  ""Sonni, quick question, is Jamba Juice as good as it used to be?.""  She replied, ""Duh, of course"".  That was all I needed.

My smoothie was 30 minutes of pure bliss.  Pure orgasmic bliss on my palate.  Thank you Jamba Juice.

A special call out to the two staff members.  They were hilarious.  Their banter while my smoothie was being prepared was priceless and make the wait so worthwhile.

Kudos once again to Jamba Juice.",4.0
2550,7ZAzGFpjkeQFKtnUOgkl0A,"I love this place. I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.

With Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.

Every single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.

On top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.",5.0

Both times I received warm or should I say hot pearls in my tea that made the cup warm to even hold. I don't know of anyone ever wanting a hot sugary drink.

2556,xwNlRAyJ1tLQQcN8IQmenA,"Finally, a non-threatening and reasonably priced Brazilian BBQ!

You have two options here: all-you-can-eat for $12 and change or pay by the pound.  The unlimited option was definitely the way to go.

Now, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD.  We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry.

The fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin.  There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible.  

Be sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like.

A special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California.  Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven.

There's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett.

All these one star reviews had me worried, but not as worried as I was about getting my husband some help ASAP. 

When we got in they told us they could see him right away, but if it wasn't an emergency he'd be sent outside to wait for a while. It didn't take long for them to realize it was an emergency. And from that moment on he was treated with the best care. The nurses were all really sweet and had great bedside manner, distracting my husband while giving him an injection, and one even brought us a snack (we had planned to eat breakfast at the airport). The front desk guy, who was struggling with our health care information, was nice as he could be about it. And the doctor was better than most primary care physicians I've had -- very patient, forthcoming with all information, and seemed genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. 

We left with a less-dying husband, feeling perfectly cared for, and with TWO doctors notes that will help us get a refund on our missed flights.

As of now it is just a tasting room that isn't yet licensed to sell pints.  So the good news is the tasting samples are free.  
However, the place isn't anywhere near fully setup and the layout is exceptionally boring.  They have 15-20 plus tap handles installed but only 4 beers on tap.  All 4 beers are IPA's.  All of their IPA's are traditional American IPA's (not west coast style at all).  IE:  No late addition hop flavors or dry hopping. They have three unique IPA's and one IPA that is a blend of the 3 other IPA's.  Boom Sauce was decent.  I'll give them credit on that.  The others where almost average, and one out right sucked.  My worst home brewed IPA tasted better than Consolation Prize.  The two guys working there where cool and very polite however, their knowledge of what's going on at this brewery was fairly minimal. They couldn't tell me the IBU's, a single hop variety used, or even how many barrel system they are using.  I talked to other locals at various breweries and they expressed disdain for the owner calling him some rich guy, and I quote ""a trust fund baby that knows nothing about beer"".  I have not met the owner so I will not express my personal opinion, however these are quotes from locals at a brewery in Chelsea.  I'm not going to knock the place for it's in the middle of no where location since I can see this becoming a very cool place some day with the right style and architectural design ideas.  If you create a cool layout that incorporates outside seating, glass walls, large wood beams, stainless, and art this place could be very cool.  Even if they don't do anything and make it a simple tap room without food it could still bring in the people.  You guys need variety.  Going all in on 1 IPA is a recipe for disaster.

Hello,
I am a retired military veteran and have had trouble with the website in purchasing my tickets.  So i called customer service.

The services and the network are great but the people there have no respect what so ever. 
This guy called Robert was in-charge of me when I walked in yesterday. I had a simple problem which would have to take a max of 15 mins, but guess what it took freaking 5 hours. 
When I told him what the issue was he responded with some vague answer, so I repeated myself thinking he didn't get it, so his exact response was "" Ma'am let me repeat myself, like I said...."" This is no way to talk to anyone. 
I just ignored that comment and gave him my phone to work on it... half an later I go back to talk to him and he does not even acknowledge the fact that I was waiting for him, he walked by me 4 times... finally I said ""excuse me how much longer is it going to take.."" His response ""it's hard to say, it might take anywhere between 10 mins to 4 days."" I was so shocked at what he said, I just told him I will be back later to pick it up, so he said ""come back at your convince"" 
So I go back at 5 PM and its still not ready... as soon as he saw me he said "" I have been waiting for you from the afternoon, but the thing is I just shut your phone so it will take another 10 mins..."" at this time I lost it. I didn't know what to say to him anymore... 
Finally after an hour I got my phone back, and when he gave it to me he says, ""now that you have your phone back, I don't think you will need my services anymore"" and walked just away. 
Don't ever go there if you have a choice, But if you do have to try to stay away from Robert. He is rude.",1.0

The decor is kinda kitsch-y, but the food is actually quite good. Serve has been kinda hit or miss every time i've been there- we've had some really great service, and some really poor service. There are 2 reasons that Bugaboo Creek gets 4 stars instead of 5. First, they're a chain, and I don't think that there's any Five Star chain restaurants out there. Secondly, their corporate offices do not make their nutritional information available, which I think is completely ridiculous. Any place that is standardized enough to be a chain should be standardized enough to have their nutritional information figured out.

I went in to get a to-go order. I asked if I could order dishes without MSG. I was told YES. Yay! There was a bit of a wait, but nothing outlandish. So far so good.

I really wanted to like it. It did not meet expectations and would not have even if I had never read all the stellar reviews.

I ordered sesame tofu -- and got the lunch deal so I could try the hot and sour soup and eggroll. I paid $1 extra for the rice to be fried rice.

Results: Eggroll just bad and greasy (went into trash); was given 1/4-1/3 cup of fried rice - even though I paid $1 extra to have fried rather than steamed rice. It was definitely not enough rice to go with the sesame tofu. I deserved at least one more small scoop of rice for the extra dollar I should think. The little I had of it tasted good. Very, very disappointed on the teen-niney portion of rice!

The sesame tofu tasted good (though a bit too sweet for my taste). I would have registered no complaint however if it were not for the several inch-plus long black-burnt chile pepper in it. Don't get me wrong. I love hot and I have no problem with chile peppers in my food. Which is why at first I thought it was just part of the meal -- until I tried to eat them. They felt and tasted dry and burnt. I took some time out to fish them out. 

The hot and sour soup? One of the worst I have ever had. I could detect neither the hot nor the sour. It looked and tasted to me more like egg drop soup, because it had (really too much) egg in it.  I'm a hot and sour soup lover -- so this was another major disappointment. I could not bring myself to finish this tasteless soup.

I paid nearly $10 for a bad egg roll, yucky soup, a smidgeon of rice and tofu heavily laden with a sauce full of burnt-black peppers. Oh, and there was an unexpected ""treat"" of some kind of fried wheat something or other. Tasteless and unhealthy to boot, that also went in the trash.

Not a happy camper. I do not believe I will be back -- but then again, maybe just for the green beans with vegetarian fried rice in a pinch.

I feel certain Gordon Ramsay would agree with me on this one! 

P.S. I love the fortunes in their fortune cookies. Words of wisdom -- very cool.

UPDATE:  A couple days after I posted this review a friend came over with takeout to share with me -- from this same restaurant~! She brought two takeout orders of the shrimp lunch deal with vegetable fried rice. She was given only a tiny portion of the fried rice (explained above). 

One the positive side, the eggrolls were MUCH better this time. i believe it is because the eggroll I was given before must have been a leftover and cooked twice (not cool). 

However, this time what was old was the fried shrimp. The batter on some pieces of it were so stale my teeth could not go through them. 

The soup was probably egg drop this time; I really could not tell. It was below par to my tastebuds. 

They need to learn one very important thing: KEEP IT FRESH. I have been served ""way too old"" in two different items on two different days in the past week, so I'll stick with the 2-star rating.

I ordered the basil fried rice and although they added the teriyaki sauce I requested which was nice the whole meal was terrible. They drowned the rice in the teriyaki sauce but the worst part was how burnt the food was. I tried to make due but every bite had a strong taste of charcoal! My guess is they cooked this way earlier and wanted to reheat it by throwing it back on the grill which they obviously are not cleaning regularly. Had to throw most of it away.",2.0

2634,a7MCvVr8BlAvayma0MXzLg,"Alright, growing up in a Korean American family, you'd think for special occasions, we'd go out to a Korean restaurant, right?  Well, that wasn't the case in our family.  We'd always go to Lee's Mandarin (Mt. Prospect, IL) for all HS graduations, birthdays and special occasions.  

That being said, I have always like Chinese food more so than Korean.  My brother Tony K. currently works at Lucky China so I thought I'd pay him and the restaurant a visit.  The restaurant is at the end of the strip mall and is cozy in size.  With the red/black decor and dim lighting, this place is definitely a cute date spot.

I had a craving for some Thai and noticed they had chicken pad thai on the menu.  Imagine that? A Thai dish at a Chinese restaurant.  It wasn't the best, but I dug it.

They also serve sushi there and had a sushi chef on hand to make you rolls on the spot.  My favorite was the ""Rock & Roll"" sushi roll.  Pretty tasty for being served at a Chinese joint.

Check this place out if you're in the area.  It's pretty good food and the price is just right for the quality of food you get.

It's a great place for take-out as well. :)",3.0

Being desperate and scared I signed this inter-office agreement. the dentist per their chart, extirpated my canals. That's it. i tried to be ahead of the game and paid $300 toward the  treatment. But after looking around more and
after talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn't make me feel like I'm scum.
Bethany dental front desk staff didn't help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn't blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating ""we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal"" I'm not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else!

2640,NAdB2AfjlqxJwY3O2l_eww,"It was my birthday so I wanted to do a date night with my husband. I am a child of the 80s and heard about this place and was eager to try it out.
Hubby and I arrived early, after reading reviews about waiting for spots to play these retro arcade games. We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. 
The place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. 
The only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return! It's the nature of these vintage machines. Thank you Joysticks for allowing me to relive my youth vicariously through your memorabilia, music, and all your retro touches.

The best part of the meal was the Octopus Carpacci. This was a truly exquisite use of seafood in carpaccio; the presentation was beautiful. The menu describes Octopus Carpaccio as ""roast tomato pasato, castelvetrano, dijon & shallot vinaigrette."" In addition, beets, red onions, micro greens and croutons finished the dish. This is one of the most unique presentations of octopus that I have ever seen and Posto pulled it off masterfully. 

For Entrée I had the ""White Gulf Shrimp, skillet roasted, white wine, oven cured tomatoes, red chile, clipped herbs, tagliatelle pasta."" This was an excellent change from their pizza.

2693,oVkwKgRjdOybV5qzHJWetA,"I had heard so much about this place working downtown in Bev, and had only been in for drinks, so my husband & I tried it. We ordered a bottle of champagne and calamari to start. The calamari came out looking delish, and we dug in. Only 3 small pieces in, we are both fishing around the plate of the hot pepper rings that came with it, looking for calamari, since it all looked the same and blended together. That was it. Three tiny bites and no more. I was really disappointed. On a seperate occassion, I complained to the chef about it and was promised a calamari plate on the house...come to find out he doesn't work there anymore : \

We ended up sharing the GIANT seafood stuffed lobster that night as our entree, which was excellent. No complaints on that one, as it made up for the stingy app.

The service was alright. Our waitress didn't check up on us as much as we liked (or needed). And I must say, one of the bartenders has quite an attitude everytime I've been in. Not only with her co workers, but towards me and other patrons for absolutely no reason either.

Nothing is more amazing then stepping out on your balcony and seeing animals. We had a balcony with a pool view that had luscious greenery abound with some animals in the distance. If you stay here, or even if you just go for a meal at Sanaa, Jiko or Boma, take a walk around the property! That's an order! Outdoors is absolutely beautiful. It is so fun going around checking everything out from the animals roaming around to the cool rockers placed around the firepit. They read stories some evenings. Also, when night falls, be sure to go to the night viewing spot and check out the animals with the night vision googles. It's a lot of fun!

The hotel itself is beautiful as well. The lobby is magnificent with amazing decor throughout. Get a tour of the AKL if you can!  There are super comfy chairs everywhere. We relaxed while waiting for a Boma dinner one evening in the couches, just taking in the atmosphere. There are some comfy chairs around an indoor fireplace which my friend actually fell asleep in front of as I was reading the story behind it. Plus, there are a couple of big balconies that overlook animal viewing areas which make for some fun!

We stayed in a Studio Villa which was huge! It had everything we could need...free Wi Fi (this is villas only), coffee maker, microwave, sink, fridge, all the mini kitchen fixens. We had our big bed plus a nice couch, table, flat screen tv, tons of space for the two of us. Plus, I loved the Animal themeing to the rooms (I will post pictures). The beauty was in the details of the room and hidden Mickeys were abound!

I loved Boma their 1 TS restaurant, Jiko their 2 TS restaurant is simply amazing, I haven't yet tried Sanaa, and Mara their quick service area is great as well. 

The pool is so beautiful! It's as if it's plopped write in the middle of Animal Kingdom---trees and greenery everywhere!

They have the usual great Disney staff throughout. I love their gift shop, as well! 

The only downfall is it's one of the few Disney Deluxe Hotels that you have to take a bus everywhere. It's close to Animal Kingdom but not too close to the other parks so there are no boats, monorails, or walking paths to the parks. However, we had zero problems with waiting forever for buses here or anything like that.",5.0
2696,tJz-j690ylVwQHTOfnwxBA,"This is my first entry in Yelp and after my trip to Vancouver, I have a reason to Yelp. 

I went up to Vancouver for five days/four nights, with my girlfriend, and thought the Empire Landmark Hotel would be a nice place to stay. The price was good, location was right, and the website made the interior look great. During the time we spent here, we found the front desk to come off a little rude and short with their answers. They put us on the 20th floor which over looked Stanley Park but that was about the only nice view we had. The room was small and looked as if it wasn't updated since the mid 90's. The towels were scratchy, the sheets were just average, and the room gave off a vibe that it could have been filled with bed bugs at one point (it didn't though). The TV was an average 19"" and when we rented a movie (not a skin flick BTW) the sound was all off on the video. I called down stairs where they then sent up maintenance to check on it and they went on to say the $11.95 charge would be taken off of our bill. When we were checking out, the charge was still there and they questioned me as if I was lying to them about the sound issue.

For the money, this place wasn't very special at all and I think next time I'll save some money and go to the Holiday Inn.

Overall my trip to Vancouver was great. Friendly people, beautiful scenery, and great food. The hotel experience wasn't so good though. Two Stars for the  Empire Landmark Hotel!",2.0

Ok, since Ladybug has sadly been having problems with the quality and accuracy lately (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ladybug-organics-home-delivery-service-and-store-surrey#hrid:x1siIpX-AQ-T_30XwQEaMw) decided to try out Green Earth to see how they compare.  I feel like I'm cheating though!  

After 2 weeks of the service (my organic delivery secret affair!) here are my impressions:

- The ordering system is much more efficient and easy to complete.  Basically a much better website with streamlined choices.

- I love how they have a recommended bin each week with the freshest produce for the week, and how much this changes from week to week to keep you constantly getting different items and keeping things interesting.

- They are VERY good at only listing the produce and fruit that is actually available when you are ordering so no missing items and/or substitutions.

- They simplify their choices, so they don't offer 4 or 5 different kinds of apples for instance.  But each week they have 1 or 2 (and actually have them!).  

- The quality of the produce has been on par or superior with that from Ladybug.  Been enjoying some of the sweetest carrots, creamiest sweet potatoes, non-bitter artichokes, delicious locally baked granola, crispy flavourful fuji apples, most flavour packed broccoli that I have had for a long time along with everything else.

- I love that for things you order regularly you can establish a standing order and get a 5% discount (milk, eggs, etc.).

- Their customer service is really on top of things.  They are very proactive and contact you quickly and efficiently.

I hope this continues, and as long as it does I think it will be Green Earth going forward!  (Sorry my dear Ladybug!)",4.0

- location is good.

Cons:

- Ordered a $22 beef BBQ dish.  We cooked it perfectly at the table but the meat was low quality, tough and chewy.  Flavor was OK.

I am dropping Potbelly a  couple stars based on our experience Monday. 2.5

I really wanted to go to Whole Foods for a burger. ( different review but their burgers are solid: Sustainable, organic, delicious. )

Mom, said Princess, I really want broccoli soup and a milkshake. 

Ok. Potbelly I guess. ( not excited about forfeiting the burger but she wants broccoli after days of only wanting pho. And I mean days). I couldn't promise broccoli soup at Whole Foods. They rotate their soups. 

Its 2pm. The parking lot is pretty empty. Its Veteran's Day.Usually this lot is nuts.  Theres a handful of people outside at tables and just a couple inside. .We stumble in to give our order to the girl at the counter. I order the chocolate shake first ( because it takes the longest ), then the bowl of soup, then a chicken salad sandwich on wheat( ""multigrain"" she says) then pick up some pop chips and head to the register. 

Ma'am? What sandwich did you order again?

Chicken salad. 

Oh ok. She says. 

At the register my sandwich is sitting on the counter next to a tray (?) And I say "" is this mine ? And he nods so I pick it up and put it on the tray while he rings it up, then he notes the pop chips, reminds milkshake maker to get the shake and  says  "" a bowl of soup"" and as he rings it up says "" we are out of broccoli soup"" and ""you can have garden veggie or southwest chicken."" He asks my daughter, ""do you want to taste them? ""

Um no, says Princesses' facial expression, there are ONIONS in those. ONIONS are from Satan. Lets be real, neither of those choices is particularly kid friendly unless a parent has made them knowing what the kid will tolerate or if the kid had no food issues whatsoever. I don't have that kid. Mutely, pretty sad really, she shakes her head. She whispers to me ""I don't have to eat.""

Grrrrr.Really?! Then he goes and erases broccoli cheese  soup from their board. 

If,  when I had ordered broccoli cheese soup, the girl had said "" we are out"" ...I would have said ok thanks and left. Or even better if I hadn't seen it on the board, I wouldn't have even had to talk to them! ( I do this at Fresh Thyme soup quite a bit. Go in, see what's left on their board...they're good at updating...and leave if nothing left will work). 

I couldn't do that now because I had a sandwich. Not a burger. Sigh. 

The helpful register man gave us a free cookie to make up for being out of soup at 2pm. So my child had a milkshake ( which she ended up not drinking btw), a cookie we gave her dad later, and my chips that have less nutrition than dirt. I had a sandwich I didn't enjoy. This was not a successful lunch. 

Afterwards I took her to Java Mama's for a bagel. I needed coffee. 

Will we go back? 

Hmm. 

Maybe not for soup. 

What a wasted trip to Potbelly. It is cheap. But...they need to tighten up their ship a bit.

I wound up at Neighborhood because I followed Dr. MaryAnn Geness as she departed Ashton/Geness. It sounded like she was having some family issues that coincided with the transition and I was told she would be out of the office indefinitely. At that point (July/August 2014) I saw Dr. Bailey and I loved her just as much as Dr. Geness. I don't seek chiropractic care regularly, but when I do I like to stay loyal to my providers especially when I feel we've built a rapport. Several months later I called and left a message to try and schedule an appointment but my call was never returned. My pain happened to resolve on its own at that time so I didn't think too much about it. Fast forward another year (now it's November 2016) and I've got some relapsing pain I want handled. Is Dr. Geness available? Still no. Is Dr. Bailey available? ""She's no longer with us."" Said in a solemn tone which I interpreted as meaning she'd died! I see another reviewer was given the same line. I asked bluntly, ""She died?!"" ""Oh, no, she just doesn't work here any longer."" So I was set up with Dr. Daishell who is nice I suppose, but doesn't instill a real sense of confidence in her craft. Just in interacting with her, she seemed a little unsure of herself and maybe like she's making it up as she goes along. I could be totally misreading that, she does have some positive reviews. The office manager is always accommodating and kind, but I don't get what's with all the beating around the bush. I had a massage there once and it was good (can't remember the name of the therapist). I mean, it's a little strange that they don't have their providers' names on their website!

pork cracklins - delicious, perfectly fried, seasoned well, and way bigger serving than I expected, 
black-eyed pea fritters - delicious, perfectly fried, larger than I expected (Asian chili dipping sauce good, but the others were meh), white bratwurst - not my cup of tea, so I shouldn't speak to this one,
caesar salad - very enjoyable, grilled effect was quite nice,
skewer trio (selected brisket, chicken, & shrimp) - this was quite a mediocre dish, came with weird uncomplimentary sauces, only thing I had that I wouldn't recommend.

The waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!

But it wasn't only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didn't notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said he'd make it right.

Instead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it.

Had a glass of wine at the bar were the bartenders enthusiastically shared their excitement about the menu with suggestions of their favorites. Upon being seated our server immediately greeted us with a casual professionalism.My group made several selections from this very unique take on the traditional burger. I found several selections I liked and a few misses. The pate burger was my favorite. The veggie burger my least favorite. Loved the vodka batter onion rings and the hand cut french fries. Not so crazy about the vegetable of the day which was a unique take on cauliflower though others at my table loved it. Overall I think Richard and his partners have a winning concept here.

2736,BcNDnaO6RuFBM6vSV54FXA,"I was not happy with my service. I got a pedicure and a shellac manicure. 

First off, I hate that you ask them a question and they have people who don't know English. I get it, most nail salons are like that but it makes me question if they are even licensed to be doing my nails. The language barrier leaves a lot of room for misunderstandings.

Secondly, they were in a rush to leave so they did my manicure and pedicure simultaneously which was uncomfortable because they were trying to twist my body in uncomfortable ways. The lady doing my manicure was skipping steps (. I'm a licensed cosmetologist so I know how manicures are supposed to be done) she also couldn't understand my English when I politely corrected her. She was standing I front of the tv the whole time so I had no choice but to stare off into space. At one point the staff we're arguing with each other which made me very uneasy as I'm trying to relax. The straw that broke the camels back was when the manicurist was trying to rinse my hands in the water my feet had been soaking in. She didn't speak or give me direction, she just pulled my hands rather aggressively down towards my feet and cause me to accidentally kick my legs forward. My left fiit, which was submerged in the water, banged against the tub. My right root was getting worked on by the guy doing my pedicure and caused me to kick him. It was very awkward and embarrassing. I even passed gas. The other clients were staring because of the yelp I made when my toe got banged.
Two days later, my toe has finally stopped throbbing.

It was not pleasant and it took them way too long to finish everything since they wasted so much time being in each other's way and arguing.

In the end I must say the older gentleman who did my pedicure was very polite and did an excellent job manicuring my feet from start to finish. I just wish his English was better.

The lady manicurist was horrible, impatient, messy and clearly didn't go to nail school.

What a waste of $50.",2.0

The owner quoted me the weekday karaoke room rate on Saturday, but he still honored the cheaper price ($15 vs. $25)! 

Both times I came here, I rolled up with a large group and ordered at least 10 bottles of Soju and two KFCs. We usually stay for at least 3 hours, and I only spend around $27! For enough alcohol to get me tipsy and dinner, it's one of the best bargains in town! We usually get the KFC chicken with the sweet and spicy Korean sauce and buffalo sauce, and both are delicious! 

The karaoke room has a good selection of English songs. I don't quite understand their karaoke grading system, but it's fun to predict your final score.

I've ordered many of the things off the menu and will attempt to recount them all.

The snow pea leaves were always good as are most of the options from the barbecue section. The lo mein was good but not extraordinary. I am not a fan of orange beef so when someone from my table wanted it, I hesitantly agreed. Since I was biased before we ordered it, I will not say it was good or bad. The salty fish fried rice was just the right amount of salty on the fish. The inconsistent things which disappoint me are the salt and pepper squid and the shrimp in tofu.

The eggs were a tad over poached for my liking; the yolk was barely runny. But as a whole the dish worked perfectly.

2772,XW7ziPoRB03e8QiQYz4bYQ,"My least favorite  of the vape shops i've been to. They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. 

Also of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.

I did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.

The prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors.

This morning was a beautiful but cool (55F) Sunday morning. I met some friends and we decided to go to Gilbert's for brunch.  I've been to this restaurant quite a few times and have always had good service and decent food.  That is, until today.  

Gilbert's won't get a nickel from me again. I have never been treated as rudely and disrespectfully as I was this morning by the manager who was on duty for brunch. 

My friends and I wanted to sit next to the window, which is an openable overhead door similar to a garage door but glass panes.  The door was closed due to the cool winter air  The only table available was near the main restaurant door, but I was ok with putting up with that door opening and closing as patrons came and went.

Our server was attentive and courteous and we placed our orders.  As soon as our coffee came, another guy came by and asked, ""Do you mind if I open the (overhead) door?"". However this was not a question - - it was a statement - - meaning, ""I am opening this overhead door"".  

I objected and asked that he not open the door due to the coldness outside.  As my friends later observed, this guy actively ignored me. He proceeded to open the door entirely.  

I pressed on and asked him to close the door.  He told me other patrons asked that it be opened.  The people sitting next to our table gave me a quizzical look.  

I asked the guy to get the manager, at which point he said he WAS the manager.  I told him, calmly, that this was bullish$t.

Again, he actively ignored me.  At no time did I raise my voice or cause a scene.  However, my friends and I picked up our belongings and went up the street to The Nook where we enjoyed our brunch and the waitstaff appreciated our business.  

If you want a nice, enjoyable brunch, I recommend The Nook over Gilbert's any day.",1.0

The pizza here is delicious. I've only had the cheese pizza, but it was one of the tastiest plain slices I've ever had. You can taste the cheese! It does NOT taste like plastic or grease covered crap! The crust is crispy and thin and it isn't overly sauced.

There is a pint and slice combo for $8 which isn't too bad! I think it should be 2 slices and a pint, but the slices are big enough that it isn't much of a problem.

The service is just great! The same girl was working both nights that I went in, she is super friendly and attentive and personable.",4.0
2780,xdhhuHg0xvsjy7aou3ArBg,"We thought about going over to Brodie Oaks to see if the new Bombay Bistro was open.  I called and found out it's opening 10/8/10, or thereabouts.  The folks I was in the car with then say ""hey, let's go up north to the other location!""  I wasn't excited to make a journey north of the river for a place I was not convinced was worth a drive.
I was SO WRONG.  Bombay Bistro's lunch buffet was Indian buffet heaven!  There wasn't a dud dish on the line.  The spices were just right, the soups were tasty, and the naan was wonderful.  I was almost shocked it was so good.  Definitely could be some of the best Indian in Travis County.
Why didn't they get five stars?  Tea service at the table was slow (my glass was empty more than full) and I did not like the dessert they had out.  Pretty picky, but I'm picky like that.  I need more tea!
The line for the buffet was constant too.  They have it up against a wall, and while there's an obvious flow, you feel slightly obliged to stand in line, waiting for everyone in front of you to shuffle through.  I little better set up here might be good.  The food is worth standing there drooling on yourself.",4.0
2781,MqJy9q0Rrb6GPju_Ko9nwA,"Welp, I've now visited this place more than 20x in the last few years.   The plus is when one happens to magically choose the ""freshest"" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.

Our consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories.",2.0

2783,kaLfE83g0FPxzL7AnDXnCg,"I'm lucky enough to have 3 Waffle Houses within like a mile of my house so needless to say I won't be returning to this particular one.  We stopped in late on a Monday night, they weren't too busy.  A guy behind the line, who seemed nice enough at first, told us he'd be right with us but then disappeared for like 5 minutes.  When he finally returned we ordered our food to go- 2 patty melts, 1 just the sandwich and the other a meal with hashbrowns and a soda.  When it came time to pay my husband questioned the $17+ price (on the menu patty melt meal was only $7, so why would one meal plus just one sandwich equal so much?).  The guy seemed immediately on the defense.  As I was signing my credit card receipt I pulled out the itemized receipt stapled to it and said to my husband ""Here's an itemized receipt, you can look at it"", just then the guy reached over and rudely snatched it out of my hand and said ""No that's our receipt"".  He wouldn't even let me look at it, nor did he proceed to offer me another receipt or an explanation of the costs.  Seems very shady to me.  My husband was obviously irritated at that point and started gathering up our food, noticing there was no mayo or ketchup packets (like they normally give you with patty melt meal).  ""No mayo?"" he asked the guy who answered with ""Hey, I was yelling at you from across the room asking if you wanted ketchup and mayo"".  Really?  Yelling at us from across the room?  This type of so called ""customer service"" is completely unacceptable in my book.  Waffle House is a southern tradition- this should include our famous southern hospitality.  My husband asked for the guy's name- which was Brett- on the way out and said he's never coming back there again when Brett proceeded to yell back at us ""Good!"".  Goodness, I felt like I was in elementary school again it was just so childish.  We left there feeling ripped off and insulted.

Why? Because... The mood needed to be set for the belly dancers- wait who doesn't like belly dancers? But wait, during the belly dancing, the employees heave stacks and stacks and stacks of white cocktail napkins...napkins, napkins, and more napkins.
The waste was/is absolutely unfathomable... And, when you factor in that napkins on the floor and the table top, are slippery... The risk manage to involved with witnessing this just pained me.
The food was a step above a chain place... I had high hopes when we were handed a mortal and pestle to make our own hummus... After that, it went down hill.

He was provided a lot of entertainment jumping off of the truck to catch a banana spider and offering to catch any other wild life that we might come across. We fed cows along the trip and saw horses and a zebra and water buffalo along the tour.

I took one bite, made a face and said ""Eww"". Naturally everyone at the table asked what was the matter! Someone else gave them a try and agreed they were terrible. I suspect were made from processed egg mix rather than fresh eggs and gave up on them, but my brunch mates asked the waitress to send them back. The second batch was no different. In hindsight I should have changed my order to eggs over easy, but it didn't occur to me at the time.
The oatmeal, which I originally had no intention of eating, was like glue. On top of that, the tea was terrible. Oh, they have fancy tea bags but they bring you a cup of tepid water to dunk them in. Some places just don't get tea!

Steak Tips - The tips came with a really good marinade, some grilled veggies that I didn't eat, and these fried that reminded me of Burger King fries.

You can still find ketchup here, maybe just in one or two sizes.

They do a good job of covering the basics. For instance, my old Publix might have 20 different types of fresh herbs, and this little fellow only had two: cilantro and parsley. Cilantro is pretty much the only one I would have bought anyway, so I'm ok with this compromise.

Additionally, there was a booger from someone's nose smeared on the wall next to one of the beds.  We asked to have our room changed, which was immediately taken care of for us.

Arriving in our new ""booger free"" room, we were looking forward to the situation improving, however, things started to get worse again quickly.  The corners of our bathroom looked dirty, like the accumulation of dirt and dust over time.  My youngest daughter found a piece of a old hotdog under one of the beds, as well as another child's missing shoe.  Why weren't these items cleaned before this room was deemed suitable for the next guests?  After already changing rooms once, this didn't feel like an isolated incident anymore.  Cleanliness was a problem at this hotel.  

The next day our tv stopped working and we had to call to have it repaired.  Not a big issue, but given the other problems we experienced, it was just another added annoyance.

The second night of our stay, our youngest daughter had an accident in the bed.  We promptly called the front desk and made them aware of what happened.  They said they would note it and make sure housekeeping took care of it when they cleaned the room.  We left our room and didn't come back until the late afternoon.  When we checked the bed, it was made but still smelled of urine.  I called downstairs again and they sent housekeeping to our room.  After speaking with housekeeping they told us they only changed the top sheet of the bed with urine on it.  The plastic underneath the urine soaked sheet and all the other bedding were left the same.  When being notified that a bed has urine on it, isn't it normal practice to change ALL the bedding???  Apparently not at the Wyndham.  

Lastly, when we decided to spend some time away from the room and visit the pool area, we were disturbed by the noise from the heavy construction.  We weren't able to relax the way we originally planned when first booking this trip.

2810,z9C1HJWHfp4INwVWSOPX-w,"OH MAN. Romers is the best. I love everything about it top to bottom.

First, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar / pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. 

Second, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. 

Third, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. 

fourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) 

The burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. 
Considering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!

finally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. 

All around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!

Took my 650 bobber there back in early sept 2011 for a full motor rebuild. Took about 7 weeks to get the bike back, was quoted $2000 best case $2500 worst case. It ended up costing me $3000. Whatever, it is what it is. Got my bike back with 1 seat spring snapped off and faux oil tank busted off. Took that with a grain of salt and chalked it up to ""shit happens"". Rode my bike home and found that the bike pulled quite a bit with the clutch engaged. Had to adjust it properly myself to correct it. By now it's close to the end of October and the weather is shit so I winterized and parked it till march. Tried starting it, wouldn't idle, took it in and was told the carbs might be gummed up. Diagnoses; needed some minor carb adjustments not gummed. Got the bike back ran ok for a couple days, parked it for 2 weeks tried kicking it over and nothin. Took it back for a second time. Diagnosis: nothing wrong with the bike no work done on it, yet now it runs...fast forward to April, went out to the garage to fire up the bike nothing not even a sputter. Called the shop on a Thursday and was told it would be looked at on Tuesday. Almost 2 weeks later they finally look at the bike, guy tells me the carb had a ""squished float"". How does a float get squished? Especially when they had been the only people that have serviced these carbs since I had the bike. Anyways they replaced the floats and said they also had to adjust the timing plate 5 degrees. "" good to go starts first kick!"" I fire up the bike, starts first kick, WOW! Problem is it won't idle. I figure maybe it needs to warm up, I hold the throttle on for 5 mins, it still won't idle, screw It, I'm late for work now so I get on and ride it keeping the throttle open so it won't stall and drive it off the lot. The bike back fired like crazy and every time the rpm dropped down like stopping at a stop sign or light it would crap out, furious I went around the block and took it back. I told the shop employees  it still doesnt run worth shit and a coworker asked him ""did u test ride it after u worked on it?"" his reply was ""no, I was just told to get the motor running""... So I guess it doesn't matter if the bike is rideable as long as it starts that's good enough for them. Furious again I was assured it would get dealt with for the next day. Received a phone call 2 hours later, the guy proceeded to apologize about the error and talked to me for about 5 or 10 mins how he had fixed the problem and the bike was good to go, at the very end of the conversation he began to say ""I hope you're sitting down, but when I test drove your bike it has low clearance to the ground and the kickstand caught the ground and I dumped your bike"".

I got the bike back after it was dumped and the bar end mirror was missing, side cover on the left side was scrapped up, muffler was scrapped and exhaust heat wrap was torn up in spots.
Paul from motomethod was very apologetic and has since ordered in a new exhaust muffler for my bike and given me a new roll of exhaust wrap to replaced the damaged one. They also polished the scratches out of the engine cover.
But unfortunately the bike still doesnt run properly. It starts up 3rd kick idles well but when I take it out for a ride it doesnt run very well. 

This shop wasn't able to get my bike running properly after numerous attempts and unfortunately I have given up on them, I know the mechanics here are skilled and properly trained and they do good work and the endless line of bikes out back waiting to get worked on is proof enough but they just werent able to get my bike ruinning right. So I am currently looking for a new shop.",1.0

2835,VAOaBLUjE2bJxanghxBUCQ,"I'm very particular about my tuna fish subs. For a food that is so simple to make that even a child could do it, one still has to realize that there is a particular taste for every individual.

Mayo or Miracle Whip? What is the tuna to dressing ratio? Celery or no celery? Onions? Canned in water or oil?

Tuna may be the most simple yet most complicated sandwich one could eat. And I think Harry O's did a good job and met my requirements of what a good tuna creation is.

But Harry lost points elsewhere. 

I asked for lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles...I think there were roughly 3 or 4 pickle slices on my sub. Tomatoes totaled the same. Yet the lettuce overflowed out of the top of the sub and dropped all over my plate, my floor, and my lap. It was a mess of lettuce.

The sub roll was nothing unique - definitely not baked fresh as it looked and tasted store bought. Some places can pull off using store bought bread, but they usually compensate with the other ingredients, or as I like to say, the ESSENCE of a sandwich. 

The service was nothing friendly. Kind of cold and strictly business. I felt nothing personal about this establishment which is usually one of the best things about buying from small business.

The place is family owned and run, and possibly overwhelmed with so much family to care for while running a restaurant, it's rather obvious I agree.  On Sunday afternoons their teenage daughter is often the waitress, she's sweet and shy, the atmosphere is pretty authentic and unique for a Cambridge restaurant.

Eating here is like eating at a friend's house, it's not for everyone, I have personally witnessed the service issues, and I can't disagree it could be better, it also depends on the day.  However, I'm also not usually in a rush when I come, it's a family meal, we come to relax and enjoy ourselves over a good meal.  

The food I've had here makes up for the service and has always been good.  It's probably also the cheapest eat in town, for a table of three we often only spend $10 before tipping (we tip well, it's a family owned business).

Summers are best here, we can enjoy the seating outside, enjoy the breeze on a sunny day, people watch, and be served outside.  I am all for supporting a local family owned and run business.",4.0

This was my first time at Warby Parker and will not be my last. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked if I had been there before (which obviously was a no) and then they explained the different sections of the store and told me that they would give me a bit of time to browse around see if anything appealed to me. I started looking at all of the frames on the wall and every time I would pull some off the shelf and try them on, I didnt like the way it looked on me or the way it felt on my nose. I did this a few times and still had no luck and became extremely overwhelmed very quickly. After about six minutes or so of doing this, one of the employees came over and started to pull things off for me to try on. The frames that he picked I would have never chosen for myself. And I freaking loved them all. I have extremely terrible vision so my lenses tend to be very thick and weigh down my glasses. He asked to see my prescription and recommended different frames that would be comfortable and fit well when the glasses were made. Two employees assited me while I was at the store and not only were they extremely well informed and helpful, but they were so incredibly kind! I've never had such a great experience picking out glasses before, ever. I've always been the kind of person that wears contacts out in public, but I'm definitely going to be wearing my glasses way more often because I absolutely love, love, LOVE the ones I ended up buying. And I would have never picked them out if it wasn't for those employees. I told my brother about the experience I had and he's going next week to check it out!

The food was too bland.  What was especially noticeable was that the spicy vegetables were not spicy enough.  There were two types of injera (the spongy bread) and only the one underneat the food (the ""plate"") was good.

They offer you the option of dining on a western-style table or a more traditional place-setting that resembles a basket.  It's a neat trick; it makes you feel like you're making choices from the get-go.

Ethiopian food is unique, flavorful, and not frou-frou; the fact that Asmara turned it into something bland and unremarkable is just heart-breaking to me.  

Here's the most useful piece of advice in this review:

The best ethiopian food in the world outside of Ethiopia is, for my money, in Washington DC.  There's a HUGE East African population (e.g., Somalis, Eritreans, etc. etc.)  They demand good Ethiopian food--and they get it.  

I know that a lot of Yelpers travel a good bit.  You may find yourself in DC sometime soon.  Save your  Ethiopian adventure for when you're in our nation's capital.  (Make sure to visit ""the U St. corrider"" the neighborhood U between 12th and 9th.)

If you get Ethiopian food in DC, you're in for a treat.

If you get Ethiopian food at Asmara, you're destined for disappointment.",2.0

2862,u_EzXbmDlWAqNuXJsAJRZQ,"Restaurant week review. Overall: just good. The entrance is weird in that when you walk in, you're amongst the dining tables. You just kind of stand there. So I stood there a couple minutes before anyone even acknowledged I was there. I understand they were full but a waiter made eye contact with me and looked away! It was another couple minutes before I was seated. Person who sat me then apologized about the wait. 

Grotto is small and in a basement of sorts. It's dark and pretty cramped. 
I also waited considerably for my order to be taken. My server was Angela. I finally ordered the calamari to start. It was fantastic!I had the potato gnocchi with mushrooms and I was really excited and hoped it would be amazing. It was good, but room temp when it arrived at my table. Parts of the dish were really salty, as if it hadn't been mixed properly or something. It was almost really good. 
The dessert was spectacular! I had the panna cotta which was simply heaven!

I would go back to Grotto on a day that is not super busy, if there is such a thing.

Oh and they are doing restaurant ""week"" all through the Month of March!",3.0

The co-op program is irreplaceable, especially as a business major.  I've had three amazing co-ops and have been offered a great job for after graduation.  The teachers seem to genuinely care about the students, as do the co-op advisors.  The academic advisors don't seem as concerned, but I also think it's due to their hectic schedules and the amount of students they need to worry about.  If I could do it all over again, I would!

2869,th0rgx_PisyQyuCIVylGjQ,"FLIP Burger Boutique has a very simple premise and a menu to match. They serve burgers -- designer burgers to be specific -- with sides and a few milkshakes for dessert. Overall, I would say that the food is good, if not a bit overthought and overdone.

My wife and I came on a busy weekday for lunch. The only available seating was at the bar, which we took. Service at the bar was a bit slow and inconsistent (we could barely find our waiter when we needed him), but the place was packed, so it's understandable. Because we were seated at the bar, we could watch the kitchen in action, which was quite fun.

Just to get this out of the way, the Liquid Nitrogen milkshakes are very cool, and the Krispy Kreme doughnut milkshake was out of this world good. Unfortunately, the milkshake was not the only thing we ordered that day...

We both so wanted to love our FLIP burgers (we really did), but just couldn't. To be clear, they were good, but too overdone. Each burger is flavored, topped, and made with a whole handful of ingredients. We found that, for each burger of our burgers, there was an extra ingredient or two that pushed the burger over the top (and not in a good way). For me, if they exercised a just bit more restraint in this respect, their burgers could really be exemplary. I really do appreciate it when a chef is willing to push the envelope, and try (literally, in this case) to 'make a better burger'. I also appreciate anyone willing to take the hamburger back from fast food and try to turn it into a culinary experience. However, this was, for us, an example of trying too hard.

Was it worth coming here? Yes, probably, for the experience, if nothing else. Would we go back? Probably not. There are better burgers to be had around town.",3.0

Our dinner reservation was at 5:40 since we were trying to catch the 8:45 show. Unfortunately we arrived about 20 minutes late due to the bus running late.  Fortunately they were able to accommodate us.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice, each room is a different art gallery dedicated to conservation.

I figured that still arriving at 6 would be plenty of time for the show but for some reason the hostess had us wait.  This was strange since it was very empty.  15 minutes later we were seated.  

Having been on safari in Africa I was excited by the menu as it had a lot of exotic meats.  We started with the charcuterie platter as a starter. I went with the duo of venison which had a venison filet and boerewors (South African sausage).  My wife went with the SA lobster enhancement and the Gobi cauliflower.

I would say i was a little disappointed by the platter and my entree.  The starter was very small and the vension and sausage were not bad but served cold.  I will say that the lobster was amazing and so was the Gobi.

I think the worst part of the restaurant has to be the service.  From the lackadasical hostess to the waiter which took FOREVER for dinner service unbelievably we did not make the 8:45 show.  On top of that it was one of our pricier meals that weekend.

Some things are fantastic (thin crust pizzas, bolognese pasta) but others are a bit bland (pasta dish with asparagus) or just not that good.  The brunch is similar - some things great, others, not so great, especially for the prices.   They are very good at seating you quickly if you make a reservation (easy as pie on OpenTable.com), which is a definite plus.

They get their sandwiches, and I don't get mine.  10 minutes pass...  After 15 minutes I ask someone who works there and they say it should be right out.  After 20 minutes I go to the counter and ask for a refund.  Turns out they haven't even started making the sandwich and the crappy-ass counter girl who looked 12 years old wouldn't give me a refund.  I finally get the manager out and he refunds my money and has the gall to ask me if he should cancel the sandwich order.  ""No jack off,  I want my damn sandwich!""   5 minutes later they gave me my sandwich.  I sat down at the table (my friends were already done eating), ate my sandwich and it was great.

Not happy about the manager . 

The food is 4star, We Have come here before with big groups before and never told to sit in 2 different tables. So much for celebrating my bday and not even be able to sit with my family. It was Tuesday 7/28 morning and they said there is not enough room to fit 3 tables together. 
There was 3 tables around us that were empty when we sat down. There was room to put 3 tables together, but instead he thought it was smarter to put 2 tables together for  6 of us and another 2tables together for only 4 people. Right there money lost for the restaurant, cause they could of sat another 4 people on that unnecessary table.

We got there at 11am & waited 40min to get drinks. Thank goodness I brought my own drinks for the kids. 40min for Orange juice!!! I ordered the kid meals with the drink and they still had to wait 1 hour for their food. While the adults waited 1hour & 30mim. We got out of the restaurant at 1:10.
It was breakfast at lunch time. They had to be understaffed, because I could tell our waiter was struggling, he was nice but feel bad for him for who he has to work with. 

The manager came and ""apologized"", comped part of our meal. But it was not good enough. I still believe he didn't want to help to sit us together and used poor judgement setting up the tables. There was no need to put 2 tables together for only 4 people. They were acting like trendy snobby hipsters, I feel they would of being more accommodating at an ihop. I regret my decision of not going to kerbey lane instead. 

Plus the kitchen must of set a plastic container on and the entire restaurant was filled with the burn plastic smell. One of my family members had to go outside. NO ONE apologized for that, people on other tables were asking what happened kimberly is the greatest no one said sorry.

If you are waiting for a table right now or are planing on going here and you get there and there is a long wait. It is because the front of the house is not functioning right. It takes a long time to get your drinks after u sit down, and will take at least 1 hour to get your food.

Breakfast was good. My 6 year old had the traditional Benedict, he ate the entire thing. My 3 year old had the carrot french toast. It was good huge serving, very very sweet.
Me and my sister had the migas steak Benedict. It was good, just felt short on hollandaise, dish was a lil dry.
My husband had the goat cheese omelet with caramelized onions and artichoke, it was my favorite dish.
My mother in law got the traditional Benedict, she enjoyed them
My dad ordered the crab Benedict. The eggs were shaped like a poached egg but it was more like egg whites with spinach and bacon that were put on a mold. He was expecting a poached with a layer of spinach and bacon but he said it was still good.

we decided on trying the mont blanc soufflé! came with vanilla ice cream and chestnut puree. and we had to try the French Honey Toast came with raspberry ice cream, pistachio, and whipped cream! 


note: when ordering the souffle, you gotta wait 30 mins ( they will tell u this...its not really 30mins...more like 15-20. ) tells u they make it from scratch. 

the japanese souffle was amazing! really soft, light, and fluffy! the texture told me a lot about the impeccable timing and skill of the cook. the vanilla ice cream topped with chestnut puree was wonderful. the taste contrast was excellent..when eaten with the souffle and the whipped cream..it was such a delight! every bite was souffle goodness..

the french honey toast was delicious as well. each toast carefully prepared. came with syrup on the side which complimented the dish well.

Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.

The food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.

Next, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.

The food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.

Lastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door?

That was the last communication Citizens had with its customers. The branch did not move that weekend, the temporary location was closed, the new one wasn't open, and customers had no bank to use - without any warning or signage. Now the new branch is open, and all three ATMs are not working. I switched to Citizens from a local bank and regret every bit of this move. This has been a horrible experience from day one.",2.0

You are seated at something like a ramen bar and you'll probably be sharing a table with someone you don't know, but it's likely that's how it's like in Japan. Our friends advised us that their tamago ramen is their best and it was so good because the broth was not too salty and the ramen was al dente. You might be tempted to get the one with more cha siu (pork), but since their noodles are their best part, you can also order just noodles when you're done your original serving.

I arrived one rainy evening to meet some friends and check out this new-fandango place.  It was certainly interesting, but the food wasn't great.  It was ok.  So that's the rating they get.

The service was alright, but the waiter was extremely bland and quiet.  It was strange for the atmosphere where I expected someone to be at least slightly jubliant.  Slightly.  That and he upsold me (damnit!) without me even thinking.  Nice play sir...

Again back to the food, there seemed to be a lot to choose from, but nothing that seemed especially appetizing.  I actually ended up getting the Ahi Tuna appetizer because it was the only thing I wanted and supplemented the rest of the meal with alcohol.  I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing, but still.  Others had the mac & cheese and were indifferent about the ""pasta and cheese-ish sauce"" as they described it.

2958,tLcEaeBGyvev7pbmqeUCng,"So my third time coming here in the past 2 weeks:

I'm a fitness buff and as such I do not eat out a lot. The two allowances for this rule are coffee and sushi. Fish Market has now snagged my ""Go to Sushi Spot"" award.

I'd learned a valuable lesson years ago when I had gone to a restaurant for the first time and gotten rather mediocre food. I didn't go back for over a year even though it was right next to my apartment. I went back and BOOOOM best dinner of the year that night.

This is a reason I withhold my reviews until I've been to an establishment a minimum of 2 times. Being my 3rd time at Fish Market, I must say this place is a go to spot.

1) It's tiny. To some this may mean a wait that they wish not to endure. For me this means no damn screaming college kids ""HEEY MORE SAHKIIII"". It also makes it feel more like a sushi bar and less of a japanese food trough service.

2) I've gotten the same waittress every time. Although the first time dining at FM there was a confusion with my order, she remedied it swiftly and with a great attitude. She's always super sweet and attentive, even promoting their ""Free ice cream"" promo while my lady and I were discussing whether or not she wanted some ice cream.

3) My sushi/ meals here have so far been consitently great. I always get a ""clean"" fresh taste from my food here. It is what I now expect. If the sushi were priced higher, as it is at some restaurants, I would not hate it due to the great quality. I have yet to try the acclaimed Avocado ball, but everything from my Eel Handroll to the Chirashi and Sushi Deluxe have been amazing.

4) Price is great. It's also why I do not fear leaving great tips. $5 tip on a $15 should ont be considered exemplary but it seems it is by current standards. Either way, don't hate when I get my food before you.",5.0

And for one coming from Boston, it really wasn't that good (but we went because there was parking...There wasn't, we looked for the parking place that people said they had and couldn't find it...Maybe we didn't try hard enough? I don't know). Anyway, really disapointing.

In terms of the food, I ordered the coconut thai chicken soup which was sweet. Actually sweet. So for me, it wasn't that good at all (not a lot of veggies but meh, for $3.50, I'm not going to make that big a stink). Also to be honest, I felt like the texture of my chicken was off, I don't say this often but it was almost like rubber, so that weirded me out. My sister got the chicken stir-fried dish with rice noodles that was actually pretty spicy and tasted good. This dish reflected what was said on yelp. My cousin's dish was also good, but not awesome so in the end it was the chicken stir-fried that was the best of all. Real bummer that out service was so lously and rude.

When we walked in the hostess was very friendly and hip. The interior isn't anything to write home about but the counter stools in one area have a nostalgic feel along with the checkerboard floor. A huge blackboard with daily specials covers one wall. On the table were thin paper placemats covered with ads. A throwback, yes, but kinda cheap and tacky. Super cold inside for me. Needed a sweater by my dining companion was absolutely fine. 

 Overall, the service was friendly but a little too friendly (not like that!) meaning too much socializing at one table for quite awhile and neglecting ours when we needed more napkins. (The napkins they had were super cheap and useless pretty much. Plus there aren't any dispensers at the tables so ask for extra when you get your food. ) Then ten minutes after we ordered, the server came back and said they were out of English muffins. Should have known that sooner but to our surprise someone had gone over to a nearby Publix to buy some!! You've now got a customer for life!

Friend ordered Eggs Benedict while I tried the chicken and waffles (how could I not?) Friend really liked his and the hash browns had the perfect ratio of crispiness. My dish was huge and could feed two people. Fried chicken was great and the waffles nice and airy. Didn't care for the strawberry butter that came with it as it left an aftertaste. My server did introduce me to the proper way to dip my chicken--hot sauce mixed with syrup. Nice and different and it grew on me.

I knew this store had recently been renovated and was wanting to see what was new.  I have to say they did a great  job.  The store is beautiful and well organized, brightly lit and very clean. And the best thing.... the two young female employees were very helpful. 

The other best change to me was there was actually prices on just about all of the merchandise!  This was always a problem with this store in the past as it seemed employees just mostly stood around even though a great many items had no prices. Bringing it to the attention of the employees made no difference. I am always annoyed when a store makes it a habit of not pricing their merchandise and cause customers to have to ask what the prices are on many items.  AND I don't think it is helpful when an employee says that I should feel free to ask like as if they are afraid I consider it an inconvenience for them!

2993,8hGunhFUt767n2MlZmSWCw,"I am known for being overly wordy.... so let me say at the start that I am stressed out about keeping this review brief!  There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.

Speaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking ""different"" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.

Not having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was ""for real.""  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http://workingclassacupuncture.org/?id=7

At this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  

The interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  

WCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  

WCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!",5.0

2998,62rHe8jHlJBLfCKhY_4n_w,I've been to this Smyrna location twice-both times for lunch.  The first time I enjoyed the buffalo wings pannini.  It was very good.  But this time I decided to try the chicken salad pannini.  It was horrible.  Chicken salad?  More like chicken paste.  The chicken appears to be ground up into a paste.  The Panini bread was cold when it got to my table.  I am glad I ordered a cup of gumbo or I would have starved.  Our waitress had to be hunted down to get some mayonnaise which I thought might help this chicken paste.  It did not.  The chicken salad is horrid and I would not recommend it.   The service today was not so great and our table was wobbly.,2.0

3000,hLPheVhfJnOaOMaM1sa2cg,"The latest addition to the VERTS brand is a massive upgrade from their tiny original location on the Drag near the UT Campus.  This location is spacious and modern, something that the campus location could never achieve given the limited real estate. They offer a variety of beer on tap (including several local breweries) and plenty of seating, which should be interesting given they are across the street from Cafe Mueller at the HEB. The doner kebab, VERTS' claim-to-fame, is still as delicious as ever and is a great addition to the Mueller development. Perhaps the most improved aspect of this location is the efficiency of the food-assembly line. The Drag location has always suffered from sluggish preparation that resulted in much longer waits than necessary given the number of people working behind the counter. The Mueller VERTS has a much more well-oiled system in place that results in almost Chipotle-esqe speeds.

We started off the meal with their philly cheese steak spring rolls. (I did not make that up.) The concept sounded ridiculous- but I have NEVER enjoyed a philly cheese steak more (and I'm from PA). Wanting a lighter lunch, I ordered their French Onion soup which was fantastic- perfect portion to fill me up and still make me feel light enough to finish the day. Luckily, my coworkers ordered their infamous mac & cheese so I could steal a few bites. It was refreshingly light, yet flavorful- cooked to mac & cheese perfection. I loved the atmosphere- with a loft-style layout, nice Euro-feeling bar when you walk in and unique artwork that makes you keep the kids at home. I will definitely return here for lunch (or dare I say dinner), and call it another success of Downtown Crossing!

P.S. After being inside all morning and wanting a little Vitamin D- I was irrevocably happy to find my myself sitting underneath a ceiling of windows beaming sunlight on me as if I had opted out of going to work and instead laid by the Charles and relaxed.

Smiles on their faces like they really want to be there. They were dressed nicely and showed us where the restroom was and the plugs at the table in case we had to wait for someone. Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. 

My room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisor's bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. 

I love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, ""shoot pool"" time.) The pool was also pretty nice, but when we stayed, it was pretty cold to be swimming.

3007,s0REfJeUp3e_1dXA5e25AA,"I can't tell you how disappointed we were in a late brunch here.  After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch.  There were six of us celebrating a birthday.  

It started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door.  Our waitress was unfriendly, lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in.  That's right, we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order.  She didn't offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer.

When our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything.  We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order.  She looked up and said, ""oh, yeah, you wanted sticky buns.  I'm looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out.""   I said, ""well, that's unfortunate, because you had them when we came in.  Do you think you can check?""  She said, ""I'll see if we might have one In the back.  Are you ready to order?""  We all looked at each other and thought, oh my god...are we being punked?

We ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split.  Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience.  We ordered our food and it came out quickly.

We ordered the prawns and polenta.  The prawns were okay but we're not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor. The polenta could have used some salt, cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop.  The corn beef hash was over spiced (it tasted like a bottle of Mrs. Dash fell into the pan).  The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced.  The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp.  The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato soufflé (it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut). It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top, less than a teaspoon.  The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned. 

When the waitress finally came over to check in on us, our drinks empty, she rattled off quickly, ""everything good, everybody love everything? I looked at her like are you kidding me, ""No.  Can you tell me what's on top of this waffle?  Is it some kind of whipped cream?"" Her response was, ""It's a sweet potato soufflé, I can get you whipped cream.""  I looked at her and said no thank you.  She walked away, didn't ask if she could get me anything else and didn't ask if we would like anything else to drink.

The food can be improved upon, bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not.  Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience.  I for one would rather drive downtown for better food, great service and an experience I'm willing to tell my friends about.

He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented. He took his time to make my cut perfect (he says he's a little OCD, which I think is a good thing when it comes to haircuts) and while the cut took quite a while, it's PERFECT. My hair is adorable.

However, if you're a girl like me who dreams of Har Gau (shrimp balls), wakes up craving Congee (rice soup) and for who eating Gai Mei Bao (coconut bun, chicken tail or cocktail bun) is forever linked to the memory of my dad taking us to the chinese bakery after our weekend lunches in Chinatown, this place is heaven.

I went to Get Sum Dim Sum for lunch on Friday. It is a very casual restaurant. You order at the counter and they give you a number then bring you your food. This is perfect if you are eating alone, as I was. It is also perfect for take out, if you just need to grab something quick you can call ahead and then stop in to pick it up. It's would not be that quick or easy at a traditional dim sum restaurant with cart service. I ordered a la carte.

It was exactly the way I like it, typical with perfect combination of cream, potato, spice and clams.  I ordered fish and chips and my husband ordered scrod.

3024,qiXrj-56RJbKRQd1VbUKNA,"This is my first yelp review because I have never felt this strongly about a business before. 

Regarding reliability and customer service, this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with.    Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   

The last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   
Since she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. 

The WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  

First cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  

The second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me ""nothing was rescheduled""...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.

The 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   
**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  
I told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   
**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  

Needless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.

3025,m0ZYSg7gujcxcgrqNLT9_w,"Argh. I just want to preface this by saying:
 I've been here several times for Dim Sum (say, 5-6) and once for regular dinner service. I know it's pricey for Dim Sum. 

Dinner was great. It was a long time ago.. I don't remember what we got exactly but it was delicious and beautifully presented. A bit more than what you'd normally pay at a regular Chinese joint, but the hike in price was more than represented in quality of food.

Dim Sum the next several times was lovely. A little more expensive than usual, but the exceptional Shanghai dumplings made up for it. My boyfriend and I could still be stuffed for ~$35 (including a bloody mary or two)... This time the bill was over $50 and we definitely weren't nearly  so stuffed..

The last time however, something was wrong. I could hardly enjoy the food as each time we selected something from a cart and our card was marked, we were rather suspicious that we were being charged incorrectly. We got 6 dishes, and 3 of them were absolutely marked incorrectly. One was off-menu but 2 little steamed chicken buns should not be a L when comparable items (all other steam buns or chicken buns) were S or M priced dishes..

The one that really got our goat was being charged the 'Special' price ($7.95) for the pork shanghai dumplings (should have just been the XL price).. We've eaten 2 orders of these every time we've been here and have tried the ones with crab (don't like 'em as much) and these were most definitely JUST pork...

So yeah. $8 for 3 little dumplings. That's insane. A fourth item (shrimp won tons) was off-menu  as well and we were charged for an XL when comparable items were priced lower. $8 for 2 fried shrimp pockets. They were fantastically delicious, but damn. Not $8 worth of delicious.

I generally don't hesitate to bring the bill to someone and question things if need be, but damn I just didn't feel like it.. I was just so disappointed that I was feeling potentially taken advantage of by this caliber of place that I have enjoyed so much in the past. I felt totally dejected and betrayed. 

I should NOT have to worry about paying the ""Stupid Tax"" here. You know, when you notice there's a random $2.95 charge on your bill and when you ask someone about it they don't even investigate, they just go ""Oh I'm so sorry! I'll take it off!"". .That's the stupid tax. If you've never noticed it on a bill before, you've probably paid it a few times. I'm generally on the lookout for it, but places definitely gain my trust and I let my guard down.

I've eaten Dim Sum  at many other places where there was no price listing to look at, and there wasn't a single English word on the little tally sheets, and I've never felt cheated before. If they've changed priced, they need to fucking make note of that on the item/price listings they leave on your table. I hope they're not just trying to take advantage of people's ignorance and hesitance to ask questions when they're sliding food onto your table if you so much as glance at it. That's how dim sum works but if you're not expecting it, it can be intimidating to say ""no, no!"" to get things you don't want taken off your table.

I'm giving 3 stars in deference to the previous lovely times I've had here, and due to the possibility that 3-4 separate servers made mistakes and/or they changed their prices and failed to mark them anywhere. If the latter is the case, that's just bad form in itself regardless, and this place is officially disproportionately priced.

""You'll want another layer of paint on that"") to engaging in fun conversation with people.  They let us stay longer than the 2-hour time frame and only asked to rearrange us a bit.

I don't understand how people find this romantic i couldn't even have a conversation with my fiance it was that loud. The waiter sat us in a corner table that was so dark we couldn't even see what we were eating, actually the entire place is dark like a dungeon.The food was bland , for 10$ you get a salad that contains a few leaves of spinach with some beets cut and filled with cheese. The chicken was dry and pasta was like chewing plastic, but for the 38$ fixed price we had to scarf it down. The dessert was decent though I enjoyed it and that's the only reason I'm giving this place one star.",1.0

They did a full examination to pinpoint the injuries I have been suffering from, a very informative consultation including charts and visuals that made it extremely easy for me to understand. They went over payment plans after looking into my insurance program to assure me I would receive the best possible care with an affordable payment plan.

I honestly have never seen any other doctor that made me feel so cared about, they really do have your best interest in mind and really go out of their way to make sure you know that.

The streams have fallen and the quality is horrible. They could have easily prepared and actually payed for a quality stream, for example the dedicated Bein Sports 3 stream that was showing the game, rather than trying to cut corners with free but bad internet streams. The management was not prepared at all for this event and there were not enough seats as well. I had to sit on the floor. If I could give 0 stars, I would.

We walked in to find the place jammed, and we were only wanting a seat at the bar.  The hostess sent us upstairs to the bar on the 3rd level, where they said two seats had just opened up from people they had just seated.  Up we went, to find two people who were seated at a table moving to the openings at the bar, and they offered us their table.  We made our move to sit at the table when the manager, who saw it all go down, rudely told us to get away from the table because he had a waiting list.

Thanks to traffic in this wonderful town, she arrived late to see some friends of mine, so we decided instead to enjoy our time in town and ended up here.

Not in the mood for a full on dinner, plus the bankroll was a little thin, we hit the bar for appetizers and near privacy.  We sat at a little table by the window at the far (as in closest to the door) end of the bar.  For the longest time, read: most of the time, we were alone.  It was nice.  Very nice in fact.

We split the Queso Fundido and Ecuadorian Potato Cakes, not realizing there actually is a menu for those without the love of meat.  But it was near divine.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Especially for cheese with peppers and other fine additions.  I wanted to take it home and slather it all over... I mean it was wonderful.  Linda loved it as well.  Washed it down with a beer and life was good.

Service was, well, spotty.  I think maybe because we were far away, or that our order was pretty plain, the waitress kind of ignored us.  Not in a ""you're not good enough way"" but in a ""you don't even register on my radar"" sort of way.  And to be fair, the isolation was nice - I hate it when servers are over your shoulder every 30 seconds, it annoys me.

Food though, eh was kind of blah when it came to main courses. Drinks were good though - especially that Big Kahuna!

We had a party of 5 so had a few different food options we got. The food was a bit pricey but some items that were just simple meals, nothing note worthy. We had a few people get the Korean Rubbed Sirloin. For the price you'd expect a pretty spot on delicious meat. But everyone agreed, it was SUPER bland! And some areas were so undercooked it was pretty much medium rare. For $43 you'd expect a juicy and flavorful meat but that dish left everyone  unimpressed. We also had the chicken wings (which were fabulous) and the Sa-Cha chicken stir fry. The stir fry as well was really bland! I was shocked because it had potential to have great flavor but again, was just not that fantastic. We did get a few appetizers which were good, which was the chicken teriyaki (which they should make into a main dish) and that was great. Also the lobster and crab rangoons were great.

Cheaper than pure spice, but tastes not worse at all. Larger space and better service. I love the cleanliness and the family atmosphere here. Their BBQ closet looks so clean and price is good too! In husband's words: its chi is centered.

I like here because I feel the food is handled with respect. The saltiness is just right. Green onion is there with tofu. Just all so right. Maybe I'm a little biased just because the room was lighted with sun not like many other place that doesn't let light come through window. It might be fengshui, dude...

I'm happy for them that they have pretty good business while we were there. Customer were continuously coming for BBQ. I'll come back to try guifei chicken. If you wanna try real Cantonese way, ask for a LiTang, daily soup(actually broth for American) as soon as you sit down. Drinking that before eating is the Cantonese way of eating. I believe that's why girls in canton are always so skinny. Personally,I always request that and mark down for the Cantonese restaurants that doesn't have it. Making broth is a big feature of Cantonese cuisine. Ask them if you don't believe me.",4.0

I went with my girlfriend for dinner during mid-week and found the place doing decent, though not busy, so we were at least seated promptly. Everything went downhill from there.
We started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster. Both were tough and practically inedible, with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell. With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll (she approved of that at least) and I sat incredulous, I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over. I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager, who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert! We went back and forth for at least 5 minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill. Still furious when I think about this now.

3060,FIhNxmlmoRb1ssJcqnTOfg,"My Fiancé and I had been into the store a few times looking at rings and speaking to Julio about having an engagement ring designed.  We decided to bite the bullet and invest in having one designed.  First alarm bell was that he requested we pay in cash.  That should've turned me off immediately.  Second was the process - which was relatively hassle free - I say relative because the first time we got the ring back the design was wrong.  

The ring itself ended up being beautiful and I loved it.  However here comes the awful part - I originally requested a moissanite stone for the centre stone as we weren't ready to invest in a diamond.  Julio talked me out of it and suggested I get a glass CZ - priced at $800.  

Julio told us the ring would be valued at approximately $6,000 after completion.  After receiving the ring I went and had it independently valued, and it came back at $2,000 - we paid over $3,000 for the ring.   It came back LESS than we paid for it! How is this possible?? I asked the valuer about the stone and he said it was CZ stone worth around $60.  I explained to him the situation being charged $800 for the stone and he said he needed proof as there were no distinctive markings on the stone. I immediately went back to Julio and questioned him about how could the ring possibly be valued at $2,000 when we paid over $3,000 for it? And he said 'Because that's how much I charge'  The discussion became heated and all I received in return was utter rudeness and defensiveness - no solution from him whatsoever.  He would not give me proof that the stone was worth the amount we paid.  

Ultimately we requested a refund on the stone and he said 'as soon as you walk out of this store no refund'  He said we could have an $800 credit note for a new stone in return of the stone when my Fiancé went in to discuss this with him, but we would have to pay his price for the new stone.  On top of this we waited over 2 months to get our appraisal from Saatchi and Saatchi and it did not come back at $6,000 as Julio had told us in the store, it came back at $3,950.

My Fiancé and I are by no means made of money, and this was a huge investment for us so for a time which is supposed to be the happiest in our lives it has turned into one of the worst.

I find it bothersome that for an $11 martini they use well vodka they don't even use Smirnoff or a lower grade vodka. A ""fancy"" restaurant shouldn't even stock that kind of vodka and knows no one wants it in a martini. The price for a regular martini with an upgrade to a better vodka was $15 and the blue cheese in the blue cheese olives was dried out and seemed to have been stuffed in days before. My boyfriend got a double jack and coke. She asked if he wanted a bigger glass or the single glass. He said single... Which ended up being equivalent to the size of a double shot glass. Smaller than any drinking glass I've ever seen. Both cocktails weren't so hot. 

The food was overpriced for the quality and size of what you get. The escargot was not as good as I would expect it to be. I've had way better at some of the restaurants they are imitating. Spinach dip was pretty good but not worth the price. Overall two small average appetizers and two decent drinks rang us up at nearly $60 before tip.

3074,7GLQ2wwLeQKn1cioMEAhRw,"I stayed at this cozy motel for a weekend during a trip to Austin, Texas to see my cousin graduate from UT. Texas FIGHT! After a long drive from California, all I wanted to do was just relax and this place offers just that.The price was right at $60 a night. The employees at the front desk were very polite and helpful. We had 2 double beds, a refrigerator (held alot of our sodas and snacks), iron and ironing board, flat screen TV, blow dryer and free wi-fi!!!! The pool was always crowded (it was summer after all). 

The only downside I can see was that it was rather close to the highway, but it shouldn't affect your sleep. Traffic around this area can get pretty bad. What may be a 20 minute drive from this motel to downtown can turn in to an hour drive. Also, the exterior of the building could be touched up a bit to look nicer. 

Other that, this place is a great place to stay if you're on a budget. Great amenities, close to most points of interest (mall, UT, shopping centers) and very affordable. I highly recommend.",4.0

3076,-6z3lnWiC7yUlc8f1G5_9A,"Not a fan. My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. 

First I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. 

I had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. 

The beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. 

My husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.

The free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. 

Our food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. 

Service was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.

The food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. 

We will not be back.",2.0

Updated review: just went there a second time. Not good. Don't go here on hot days!!! Their Air Conditioning is NOT sufficient to cool inside, it was miserable and they had all windows closed and manager (she) refused to open windows early evening when it was windy outside and cooler than inside!! Scratching my head in that decision. Carne Asada Fajitas were great but flour tortillas in enchiladas are like 'Rubber' very disappointing and it was the same comment from two different people other than myself! 

Well after reading some of the negatives it reminded me that bad news travels fast and good news travels slow. If you're reading this you should remember to read between the lines and differentiate if you can, who's being accurate and who is not worth listening to. 

The other reviews made me realize that there are a lot of people who live around here that have no concept of attending an adult restaurant. I always scratched my head why some parents bring children to restaurants that are clearly for adults when they SHOULD be taking their children to Denny's or some other 'family' restaurant! The last thing people want to do is to go to a very nice place and listen to annoying children being loud!!!! Or worse, a baby crying! 

The fact is this is an obvious restaurant geared for adults. Our kind of place. The first compliment I want to give is to the ambience.  It is fantastic--from the decor to the very large windows that open to the street on both sides of the building. The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Prices were inexpensive, I think they should raise their prices! This would help keep a more high end clientele. In viewing the menu I knew the food was going to be good just based on their flavorings and descriptions. 95% of all Mexican restaurants make generic Mexican food! Yes, that food is good as well but, once in awhile you will come across a rare find. The only other upscale Mexican restaurant I have found is Javier's in Newport Beach, CA. 
At Matador, the food was good. I like how you can choose a traditional dish but then they have variety of flavors and spices from which to choose for the preparation. The Queso was just ok, it's more of a bean dip with some cheese. They need to reverse it and have less bean dip and a lot more queso. With the Street Tacos they should allow you to pick what meat you want inside. Here they give you 5 tacos, each with a different meat and flavor. We found we preferred 2 of the 5. Chips and salsa were good. Salsa could be a bit more spicy. But the way they make it will allow more people to enjoy it. I would recommend having 2 salsas and let the customer get what they want. I like spicy, my wife doesn't.  The best plate I had was the Spicy Mexican Shrimp with habanero sauce and a Jalapeño Corn Bread. This plate was amazing! At the end of the day I told my wife, ""Why would we go to any other Mexican place when we can come here for the ambience?"" Most people take pics of the food. To me it's all about the atmosphere. 

We just moved to The Pearl and have not been to another Mexican restaurant in Portland prior to The Matador. No need for us to look any further!

The staff were friendly, but it seemed clear that the process for renting a vehicle is cumbersome and not easy for the staff to understand intuitively. On the positive side, the vehicle was fine and the return was the complete opposite of the experience when I picked the car up. As far as the ambience is concerned, it had the appearance of a cheap disco and the music was really annoying.

he salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more.

Like most of the reviewers here, I formerly enjoyed Azul Tequila very much. I visited weekly or biweekly to enjoy their menu's intriguing balance of traditional TexMex and deeper-in-Mexico dishes. However, in the last six months or so, they've slipped badly.

Service has deteriorated to the point that waiters don't even bother to wait for the answer to the question, ""How is everything? Need anything?"" Instead, the last two times I've dined, the waiter threw out the question as if dropping an envelope in a mailbox, and then KEPT WALKING without waiting for an answer. I had to flag down the waiter on his way back to make a request (another napkin, simple stuff like that.)

Now table cleanliness has deteriorated to the point that I wonder about kitchen conditions. On my last visit, when the restaurant was not busy at all, the waiter filled in for the host to seat me, and led me to a booth. He took my order for tea and walked off, not noticing or caring that both the table and the bench seat were littered with crumbs. I called back the waiter, who wiped the seat, then plopped the menu down on the filthy table and actually scattered the table crumbs back onto the seat! Not noticing or not caring, he walked off again. 

So I walked out without saying another word.

3096,pYeDTrr1V3KDKonq2DhRLg,"So, I went to this Cabela's on Black Friday to purchase the Walther PPS.  They were out already (of course), but gave me a ""Firearms Request Form"" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock.  A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks.

Two weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's.  So I start a series of polite calls to the store.  And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with ""Jay"", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00.  After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s).  

Needless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call.  Apparently once I left the store with that ""Firearms Request Form"", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can.  Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370.  Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess.  So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's.

I do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all.  Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back.  Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service.  Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's.  And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it.  Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.",1.0

We arrived at around 6 PM and even though the patio was pretty busy the inside seemed dead.  We asked the host how long the wait would be and he stated 45 minutes for inside, as we were conferring to decide if we were going to wait he walked away.  As we were talking I looked into the restaurant and saw at least 3-5 empty tables and then as I walked around looked into a second room and saw literally 15-20 more empty tables.  When the host returned we asked about all the empty tables and he said he could not seat us because they did not want to overload the kitchen.

Advice: Arrive early. By the time I filled out the intake form and was on the table, it was 10 minutes past my appointment time. The lady giving me my 60 minute massage did not adjust for this, and after 50 minutes a kitchen timer went off and that was it.

I asked for a deep tissue massage, and the deep tissue part was delivered without regard for finesse. That in and of itself wouldn't stop me from recommending the business; I have a high pain tolerance, and each masseuse has their own style. I did feel uncomfortable, however, being called ""m'lady"" repeatedly by my masseuse. Also, the last couple of minutes of my massage consisted of my masseuse grabbing handfuls of my upper traps and grinding. Painful. It could have been fine if she'd taken the time to transition into a less stressful type of massage before finishing, but she really stuck with her timer, which again was not set for the 60 minutes for which I'd paid.

3107,yl9dv8CHOb8sb-sjJNT-Rw,"I have had something personal going on so I haven't been able to write a review until now. Most of my friends who have beautiful hair have said nothing but positive things about Van Michael salon so I was very excited when I needed to get a haircut and finally made an appointment. Here's some background: my hair was down past my waist and I had some blonde highlighting/balayage toward the middle and ends. Notice that I am using the word had.

 I booked the appointment with one of the new talents and had to wait almost 2 weeks for the appointment. The salon was very nicely decorated and was extremely busy with zero empty chairs. Here is where things start to go south.

 I met my stylist and she was very nice- I won't say her name because I really don't want her to get into trouble. She asked me what I was thinking of doing with my hair and I explained that since I did have very long hair I did want a cut that was more substantial than a trim and I gestured to her on my body about how long I wanted the cut, which was about to my mid-chest level. This would have been a cut around 6 inches. Remember that I came in with waist length hair. She said ""wow that is a dramatic cut"" and I said ""Well it's not that bad, I will still have length"" and she agreed and I didn't think anything of it. Looking back this should have been a blaring red alarm. I also said ""I was thinking of bangs in the front"" and she dismissed me with ""no I wouldn't do bangs on you."" 

 So first she gave me a one minute shoulder massage which I was not expecting and was actually kind of painful because I was tense. After this she led me to the basin and washed my hair and did a nice scalp massage. Then she took me to the chair and got started. She was asking me some kind of small talk question- like where I'm from or something- when she started making the first cut and this was the end of my long hair. I guess there was a miscommunication where she didn't understand how long I wanted my hair? Or maybe she wasn't thinking and just did it from muscle memory? I have no idea. I wish that I had vocally stated where I wanted my hair to be in length because unfortunately the stylist cut almost an entire foot of my hair off. There was no going back- she cut the entire length off with the first snip. 

 The only thing I can do is beg the salon to implement a policy of when someone comes in with very long hair, to please show the amount of hair about to be cut and confirm that it is okay to cut so much off. This could have been prevented if she had shown me the amount she was about to cut, but it was too late. I was staring at my reflection and I stopped talking and she noticed this. My hair went from past waist-length to just above my collarbone. She did some choppy layers and the haircut would have been very nice if it was what I wanted, but it's not at all remotely what I wanted and I was so proud of my long hair and it is all gone now. She cut so much off that the highlights/balayage I had in my hair were cut completely out as well and my hair is all monotone. I did not saying anything because realistically it was too late and there is nothing anybody can do- my hair can't be reattached. I went home and cried. The last time I had my hair this short was when I was in high school and I hated it as much then as I do now.  I will have to wait the year or more for my hair to grow back. When it does, I don't think I will risk going back. So, PLEASE, Van Michael- have your stylists confirm when they think a dramatic cut is about to happen.",2.0
3108,0sZ6sfLLn4OCntsgw9vToA,"Yeah, it's fair to say that I don't really get the hype. They're ok donuts, they have some interesting flavors and toppings, but the donut itself isn't great. The yeast donuts are overly chewy, the chocolate glaze VERY liquidy and has trouble staying on the donuts themselves, and the donuts are just missing something in the flavor (maybe a bit more salt in the dough?)

I've tried five or six different donuts here over several visits, and still in my mind the best thing that they have is their basic glazed donut holes.

We  got to the restaurant at 6:20. No one came to offer us even menus or water  until  we Had been sitting  for about 35 min.  They had a large party on the other side of the restaurant. They were only paying attention to that side.  There were only two tables with patrons on this side of the restaurant.   There were people / staff standing around doing nothing initially and still did not come to ask us anything.  The music was so terribly loud from the party side  we could not  hear each other nor even converse with the waitress when she finally did come. Most of us developed headaches .We finally ordered and it took over an hour for the kids pasta to even come out. Close to the end we could not wait anymore. The kids were asleep on the bed/seating area. We had to get up and leave Before our dinner even arrived.  The waitress told me to go get some fresh air from outside.  And that the food should be ready soon.  it was 28° and raining, by the way.  Was she out of her mind!  1/2 of us left while the others waited for the food to come still... 

My husband  stated that this is the most horrible dining experience has ever had",1.0

Every time I go to a Starbucks drive-thru , I ask them to leave room for cream and ask for a little half & half in a separate cup (because I like to add the amount I want).  Every other location has done this without any problems.  This location charged me an extra 60 cents just for an inch of half & half, which I would have added inside the store for free.  What the heck?  The next day I stopped by again, but made sure I asked for the cream after I had paid.  Both times, the girls were not the least bit friendly.

3112,6YKhJgWYlp1MeSyzhcR2VA,"I purchased 2 hrs of moving services from Move Drs on Jan. 24.  I called Move Drs on March 26 or 27 to schedule my move date of April 6, which was ultimately scheduled for 10:00 am. Move Drs called at 10:20 on April 6 to cancel. Their reason was that they had a fire in their office and when I asked, they reported that they did, in fact, have mover crews and trucks available, but the manager decided to bring the crews in to clean up the office instead of taking care of the appointments that they had already committed to. I certainly hope there were other extenuating circumstances.  It seems like a better choice would have been to hire a cleaning crew and kept the moving crews and trucks working to take care of the customers. 
    Move Drs also told me twice they would find another company to move me later that same day but I never received either a call from a new mover, nor a follow-up call from Move Drs. All of this was last minute and ended up costing me substantially more in surcharges since I did not have a prior scheduled appointment. . To me, Move Drs views their business as a one-time customer exposure with little attention to any repeat business and cares nothing about service",1.0

The waiter, Leonard, was great. I also liked the kitschy interior.

The food was  bland. Some items weren't even fresh. 

The first thing we were served was cold HEB sliced italian bread. If you are not going to bake your bread, then get some interesting bread and warm it up. This is one of the worst bread experiences I've had at a restaurant. I would recommend not even serving bread. 

We got the house specialties at 20 bucks per entree. 

The owner needs to go to Vespaio or  Asti's and see that you can get food, which is ten times better for a few bucks more. 

I'm not trying to be cruel but the marinara at Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill is so much better. I would have rather eaten at either of these two places. I actually think Macaroni grill is pretty good. Verona's is not even half as good.

You may say, well kid that's pretty much normal anywhere you go on a busy night. But the fact is the place is not crowded at all. The entire design of the bar was horribly added into the space provided. It takes way too long to get a drink in here and you constantly have people on top of one another trying to get one.

3121,zq2SY08gUQjzIx0uWXs2aQ,"I took my Sorrento Diamondback in to the shop here on Anderson Lane because the left pedal had reamed out its socket in the crank arm. Should be an easy, cheap fix: replace the crank arm. While I'm at it, I thought, I'll treat my bike to their top to bottom tune up--my main commuter vehicle deserves the love. 

Five weeks later, after two trips, and $112 paid out, the bike is in worse shape than when I took it in. I can deal with the up-sell. ""No, we won't replace the crank arm. But we can get you a new crank, new arms, new pedals, and new toe-loops."" Fine, just get my bike back to me. ""Sorry, man, the there's no workable cranks in the whole state of Texas. It'll be a while."" So, three weeks later, my bike is back to me with all these shiny new parts, and I'm out $112. After all that time, you'd think they'd have had half an hour to give the bike its tune up, but that seems to have slipped the repair shop's mind. 

Which is a pity, since if they'd taken the time to tune the bike, they might have realized that the new crank was completely incompatible with the front derailleur bracket. The bike wouldn't shift out of the gear they had it in when they installed the crank. So, back I take the bike to the shop. ""We're going to have to order a new bracket"" they say. Leave us the bike. So I'm out one bike for the second time. A day or two later, I get a call back--""Hey! Magic! We just adjusted the bracket. You're all set!"" So I come to fetch my bike. 

Today I rode in to work. Guess what--the chain still rubs fiercely against the bracket in several gear combinations, making terrible noises. I only really mind because my primary cruising gear range is completely inaccessible to me. 

Follow-up: After three trips back to the shop, and the addition of some new, complimentary hardware (new chain, new front derailleur), the scraping is now back down to a manageable level. If you're willing to invest some time in making sure things are set right (I spent an hour an a half in the shop with the friendly tech, John, while he worked on trouble-shooting the chain grind), things will eventually be set right.

Follow-up: After 48 hours out of the AC'ed shop and in my nice, warm Austin garage, the chain is back to grinding at high gears. It looks like the crank that PB installed is just incompatible with the geometry of my old bike and grinding and chain-eating are just some things I'm going to learn to live with. This shop could learn a lot from the adage, ""measure twice, cut once."" Save your time, save your money, take your bike some place else.",1.0

Sad to say, the food has been maddeningly inconsistent. The pizza has never been bad, but then again, it is nothing to get excited over either. The ""homemade"" pasta?

3159,z35v8YO48BTGzt8OgKsbYQ,"Taste of the food was great - very fresh sashimi and seafood dishes. 
The salmon bento set was a little disappointing for $13+. Two pieces of salmon with a bowl of rice, salad, and 2 teeny little fish cakes. I would hope for maybe a sushi roll on the side, but nope. The salmon itself wasn't spiced/seasoned at all, so thank goodness for that slice of lemon. You may want to ask for hot sauce too. 

Authentic flavors of appetizers and the miso soup didn't taste like it was from a mix but my biggest complaint is probably the value for money. You may be better off hitting up one of the other smaller shops in Porters square for a slightly cheaper meal as long as you don't mind NOT sitting in a ""real"" restaurant (with doors and all.)

With two curries and a dhal, rice, the freshest naan I've had in awhile, salad, and pakora (? or something like it), it was an absolutely perfect meal. We topped it off the fresh chai.

3166,1IxfwjZZPJYLI-zFtx_rzw,"This review is of the tower across the street from the main gambling building. 

Building and 2 queen bedroom was in great appearance. Convenient access to the Skytrain; about 10-15 minutes into downtown Vancouver. 10 minute driving distance to a row of restaurants; also has a 24 hour fast food area in the hotel. 

Other facilities, besides the Casino and concert area, includes a small workout area overlooking the pool. Workout room has cardio equipment (stair climb machines) and dumbbells up to 30lbs only. Pool area (open till midnight) is fun because of the waterslide. Pool is located near; and provides easy access, to the boardwalk. 

The 2 negative points I have on this place is that 
1) It's not in a complimentary area. I think with a more green area and/or retail stores surrounding the hotel, it would be more attractive. 

2) You are near the airport. The few planes that I heard flying over the hotel was louder than I would have liked outside. In the hotel room (11th floor), I barely heard the planes. So warning to all those light sleepers. If you are a light sleeper, this may not be the best place; unless you try your luck with a lower level floor, which may help reduce the sound even more and completely. FYI - they sell ear plugs in the sundry shop located in the main building (which is open till 2am).

Overall, I would stay there again if there are good deals.",4.0
3167,go1Gh0Te-XVgPxCibeusug,"The venue has so much potential, but unfortunately falls flat.

The Good:
1. Great sound! It really is a great listening experience.
2. Ample seating for an outdoor amphitheater.
3. I have nothing else nice to say.

The Bad:
1. Parking! We paid more for parking to park in the closest lot. More than the already overpriced regular parking. We got there and the closest lot our ticket said we could park in was suddenly for VIP only. Our ticket said we could park there, but no. The next closest lot is not super close.
2. Getting out! What a traffic train wreck after every event (I've been to three). There's got to be a better way to streamline folks out. Even in the closest lot to the venue we still sat in 20 minutes of traffic to get out. 
3. Food. Over priced, as expected. But what a woeful selection! The same bland food trucks at every event I attended last season. Why limit it to three or four trucks? Why not have 10+? Limited beer selection as well - this is Austin! Step it up!
4. Bathrooms. I only noticed 2-3 actual bathrooms. The first women's restrooms we came upon had, at minimum, 50 ladies in line waiting. Seriously? Either that or head over to port-a-John haven. I can't believe a venue of that caliber, a Formula 1 racetrack, has port-a-potties. Unacceptable.
5. No smoking? How about police that. People on both sides smoking through the entirety of a show just ruins it when you're a non-smoker.
6. Lawn. We had lawn seats once and I'll never do another event on the lawn. No blankets or low chairs? I've never seen a lawn where you can't bring a BLANKET to sit on! So it's basically sloped standing room only in the (sometimes) mud. No thanks - why would you pay for that?
7. Screens. Why so small? Disproportionately small for the size of your venue. Time to upgrade.

Unless my favorite act of all time comes I won't be going back to this venue. I expected some bumps when they first opened, but those should have been long fixed. The venue could have been just what Austin needed, but instead it falls way short of its potential. Look at a place like Pine Knob in Michigan. Take notes.",2.0

It wasn't busy when I arrived with my friend, and when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We stood there for a few minutes before the hostess walked up, and just looked at us until we spoke up that we needed a table for two. She told us that if we sit at the bar, the food is 20% off and when we nodded, she said ""seat yourself"" in a rude and unwelcoming manner. She failed to smile at us or make us feel welcome throughout this exchange. 

We found seats at the bar, and the bartender was nice to us, although she took a while to acknowledge us and bring us hot sauce when we asked for it. I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our food was cold for the most part. When we finished eating, we sat for over 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged.  The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders. If anything, it felt like she was avoiding us. I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going. 

After waiting, she finally said ""I'll be right with you."" 
It took her another 5 minutes to be ""right with us."" She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else, which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out, feeling even more unwelcome than before. 

The food was mediocre for the price that we paid. For a nice and pricey cafe, the staff was very rude. I could have very well spent my money elsewhere that is even busier but still receive superb service.

We ordered Chinese delivery from this restaurant.  The portions were large but not tasty.  

The egg rolls are strangely filled with pork only...alas, no cabbage or anything to give it a crunch.  Just a ""mushy"" diced pork inside.  Ewww...

The egg drop soup had a nice flavor but was underwhelming.  There were mushrooms in it but none of the mushroom flavor permeated the broth.  Mushrooms must have been added as an afterthought.

The overflowing portion of pork fried rice had little to no flavor, and the pork pieces were extremely fatty....ewwwww, again.

The Hunan chicken had bell peppers, water chestnuts, and bamboo shoots along with the chicken.  The sauce had a hint of spice but certainly nothing worth writing home about.  Too much ginger flavor.

Even the coffee is top notch -- it's all Batdorf and Bronson beans. A cafe au lait is my go-to, but I'll get a drip coffee every now and then. They usually have two types brewed. All in all, it's typically about $4 for coffee and a pastry.

After going to Beast a couple of years ago and falling madly in food love, I knew I'd give Expatriate a shot. 

First things first, the website is a real turnoff to me. It tries too hard with its microscopic, unreadable black writing, clever titles and statements like 'open eight days a week.' Barf. Portland doesn't need places to try any harder than they already do. Let's agree to not give the rest of the world reasons to make fun of us.

Moving along.

Crab Rangoon--This isn't your favorite Thai restaurant's crab rangoon. The crab is so fresh, so delicate, so tasty. The won tons were cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet.

In fact, many of the dishes here incorporate amazing flavor combinations and a stunningly perfect heat.

Chinese Sausage Corn Dog--This was the only miss. My first bite was all dough and frankly, all donut. In fact, I'm guessing this is the same dough they use in the donut dessert. But as is, it missed the mark. The sausage is too sweet and gets lost in the sweet dough. The hot mustard is almost inedible, so there is nowhere to take this sweet, carby mass on a stick. Skip it.

Onion & Butter Sandwich--Everyone knows that James Beard was the mac daddy of all chefs. Actually, I have no idea who James Beard was (is?), but I know if you're a James Beard chef, you're pretty amazing. I also know this sandwich of stinky, fatty, Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook items is heavenly, I mean completely divine in my mouth. 

Brussels Sprouts & Ground Lamb--True perfection. I'm not a fan of sprouts, I merely tolerate them. This is a complex dish in which every bite makes a statement and invites you back for more. This dish embodies a team--the individual ingredients are less powerful than the way they work together. 

Korean Fried Game Hen--Plenty of meat on this bone, deliciously fried and flavored. Like the other dishes, you practically want to lick the plate because it's covered in special sauce and other tiny, sweet morsels.

The space is great--modern, romantic, hip, intimate, but maybe a bit cramped and way too dark for food that amazing. It's like she's trying to prevent the food porn culture from plastering every moment on Instagram. 

Our server was really friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic. I thought it was a little much when the gentleman who delivered our food told us that the silverware was made of radon (see paragraph one).

Unsurprisingly, Naomi Pomeroy proves that in Portland, it's quality, not quantity that wins. You don't have to own 10 restaurants (or even three) to make a statement in this town. In fact, I'd like her to stay small, stay focused and stay amazing because of it.

Before last times visit I would have given this pace a solid 4 stars. The seafood was ok but mostly because the happy hour is very very good. Lots of choice for drinks and great appies- most under $6. Great value for a trendy place. 

Last time we came here it was a different story.. 

we booked in for happy hour for my friends stagette so we could come for some drinks and appies before going elsewhere for dinner. I had called a week prior to reserve a table and was told by the manager Omar that we couldn't reserve for happy hour. I was disappointed and my friend then decided to call again a couple days later and she succeeded in reserving for 5 for happy hour... not sure what the disconnect was but it was a different manager who took her reservation. 

Anyways we arrived for happy hour on the day of her stagette excited and ready to eat and drink and be merry - and were seated with no issues in the dining room. The sever was super nice and she helped us order right away etc. When our tuna appies came (we ordered 2 different kinds), 2 of us girls at the table noticed they smelled kind of off... very very fishy and we all tried a piece of one of the Dishes. It was inedible and tasted rotten. We eat tuna a lot (all of us) and definitely know what ""off"" and not fresh smells like. We then sent it back and told her that it was super fishy and smelly. She obliged and was very apologetic. She took the dishes off our bill right away no questions. 

My friend - who was the bride- wanted to order some oysters that were on the happy hour menu and we talked to our server about the risk of the virus circulating around BC in oysters. She assured us that ALL of wild tales oysters are tested thoroughly before they come into their restaurant and that we had nothing to worry about. We had some oysters. They tasted great and then we went on with our night. All was fine and dandy until the next day in the earlier afternoon when all of us girls who had tried the tuna and oysters became violently ill- throwing up and other things associated with food poisoning..... I won't get into more details lol 

I called the next day and let the manager Omar know about what had happened. I told him only the girls who had the tuna and oysters had become ill and the illness was consistent with food poisoning. He immediately became defensive and told me that no one else had called and MANY MANY people had had the tuna and oysters with no complaints that night. He said he would call the Heath board and report it and he took my information down so he could call me back etc. 

I never received an apology, nor a call back, nor any condolences for what had happened.

Their hospitality was disappointing as we made reservations the night before for 8pm on a Tuesday and when we arrived the female server said our table wasn't ready and if we left and came back in 20 minutes she'd be able to push 2 small tables for our group of 4. She didn't seem apologetic at all.

A male staff member then handled a group of 5 Caucasians that were behind us in line. The one guy in the group said he had called in reservations about an hour ago. They got seated right away at a table right in front of us. Wondered why we didn't get that table.

We discussed the server's demeanor and whether to go elsewhere.

The server said they would call us once a table was free so we left for drinks at Yagger. We went back to Cinara and there were several tables available, yet no one had called us back.

In terms of food, standouts were the $8 Chicken Liver Parfait with cornichon, capers & garlic scapes, $17 Albacore Tuna Charred Broccoli, Black Olives & Smoked Tonnato, and $16 Beets, Foie Gras, Sunflower, Espelette & Red Wine Reduction.

$33 Beef Short Rib, Farro, Toffee Shallots, Fiddleheads & Black garlic were a 4/5.

3188,MvbnhlTPb-G8IFoRoztaUg,"Upfront confession:     I've only bought one other car in my life, and that was in the days when it was still appropriate for my dad to go with me to the car dealership. Buying a car can be an intimidating process.

I've had my heart set on becoming a Fiat owner since back in June, which is when I first learned of their re-entry into the US market. And the awesome folks at the Kelly Fiat Studio couldn't have made it easier to make my dream come true.

I have to seriously wonder if the salesman I worked with, Dave S., is psychic.  Armed only with the information that I wanted a standard transmission 'pop' 500 model - he led me to the exact car that I had been building obsessively on the Fiat USA website. Creamy white, with a two-tone red & cream interior and a panoramic sunroof. I was doubtful they would even have one in those exact specifications on the lot! 

I was comfortable throughout the entire process - from lot, to test drive, to financing, to the moment two days after my initial visit when I returned to pick up my new love.  Every open, responsive person I worked with helped to create a fun, no pressure, no drama environment. The Kelly dealerships motto is ""we make it easy"", and they do. 

I'm committed to dealing with Kelly Fiat for at least the next three-years of service for my new car, and I look forward to updating my review as I work with the service staff.

You will not be disappointed by the donuts, but you will probably get a bit of a sticker shock on your first visit.

However, the space is clean and neat. The donuts change constantly. The flavors are unique. The service is excellent. If you want a cool donut experience, check these guys out. However, its a bit too pricey to be a regular stop.",3.0

3198,E8pXvCAGKdDcNQTx7e7yQg,"I took our 8 month old pit mix pup here about once a week for about 2-3 months. At first he was exhausted when i picked him up but after 2 months i noticed he was full of energy when I picked him up. When I would pick him up he was always in a kennel by himself and the owner brought him out to me a few times making comments about his pit bull energy. Yes, he plays rough.. he is a puppy. That is why i pay $30 to take him to daycare, so he can burn that energy off and learn to socialize. The last few times i picked him up i noticed not only was he full of energy but he was also cowering when we pet him which he had never done before. I just had a gut feeling something wasnt right. I called them and asked if there were any issues with him and I was told the day before he had been in ""time out"" several times for ""instigating fights"" and ""being aggressive."" This is a dog that LOVES everyone and has NEVER shown aggression before. When we raise our voices at him he goes in his crate. I asked why they havent addressed this issue with me and didn't get an answer expect that I might consider walking him more. Isn't this why I am paying for daycare? They did say they would monitor his time outs to let me know, but at this point I don't trust that good things are happening for him there. I have since heard some very unsetteling things about what goes on here. I won't get into because it is not something I actually witnessed but it validates what I thought was going on based on what I experienced with our dog.

3201,E1O2hUkL9sY84opDk8uxMQ,"I feel like I just visited the Greek restaurant at Epcot Center. 

The other 2 star reviews I see on here are pretty much spot on with how I feel. 

For $59.90 for 2 people to have the meze tasting spread, the food is sure as fuck not worth it. With a $25 gift card, it still isn't even worth it. I am seriously unimpressed. 

Note that this spread is stupid as hell if you do not at least get 2 $12 plates, 2 $10 plates, and 1 $7 plate. You save $.10 this way, but swap out any of those others for another $7 plate and you're better off ordering them one by one.

The spreads: I loved the htipiti one, at least I can figure that out from the menu, but the other spreads, I have no idea. The guy who brought them out didn't bother to waste his breath telling us what they were. My guess is one was eggplant and the other was the potato one, which just tasted like hummus. 

For the plates
zucchini fritters - I liked these, but damn that saffron yogurt was strong. For $7 for some little balls of fried shredded zucchini, you can make your own and not have to pay for the saffron.

calamari - my boyfriend ordered it, I won't touch it. He only ate half. He said it was the worst calamari he ever had. Usually he will eat something even if it's bad. 

saganaki - it was okay. I've only had it one other time in my life and don't remember it. 

lamb pie - this was the only thing I would order if I was forced to come back here. 

lamb shank - somehow this lamb was awful compared to the lamb in the pie. The accompanying sauce did nothing to help it out.

The service sucked. I am sorry I did not wear my pearls and I don't have enough wrinkles on my face to warrant any attention from the people working here. There were long periods of time when my water glass was empty. The server was not very interested in explaining the menu beyond the fish. It gets really annoying when the people bringing food out play musical chairs with everything on the table and just leave the empty plates. Both tables on either side of us had all sorts of attention on them and there we are in the middle like we rolled in dirt and came in.

The ambiance sucks. While the whole like Hercules movie set looks cool, the closeness of tables does not work with Americans. I do not need to hear about Betty's latest botox session next to me. It really seems like a place to throw money at food and be seen. Not in a million years.

At least the valet guys were nice. And as someone who normally hates anyone touching her car, this is the greatest compliment I can bestow on someone. It even looked all important out front, unlike how I got to feel inside.

I got my mom an iPhone for her birthday and encouraged her to go to Tech Zone to switch her phone number from ATT to Ultra Mobile. After my mom's experience, however, I'll never be going to TechZone again or recommending this place to anyone.

The next thing I know my mom is calling me stating that the girl who helped her didn't ask her if she would like to transfer her same number, so ended up signing her up with a whole new number. Then, when my mom said that she would really wanted to keep her own number, the girl told her she would have to go to AT&T to get them to help. My mom promptly went to AT&T after and as expected they said that was not something they could do. My mom also asked the girl if she could have her transfer her pictures and contacts and the girl brought out this large machine from the back room that was so dusty that it didn't look like it had been used for at last 10 years. 

My mom went back to UltraMobile and asked them if they could sign her up with UltraMobile with her old number without paying another $20 activation fee. The manager said no. My mom told the manager that the girl who helped her earlier didn't seem to know what she was doing. The manager said she's ""good"". When my mom told the manager that the old machine the girl brought out to ""transfer"" the contact list was covered in dust and looked like it hadn't been used in decades, the manager said that it was dusty because of the construction in the mall. I'm surprised she had the willpower to not call him a liar to his face.

When I went with The Boy, I was excited because the space is small and the recognizable Korean Omma which usually is a sign of good food ahead!

Kaju's menu isn't elaborate, definitely straight-to-the-point. Soft tofu, clay pots, BBQ, a few appetizers and then what they call a 'special menu' that consists of fairly typical Korean fare like Bibimbap, Ttokbokki, Panjeon. I took photos of the menu since there can't be one found online (besides for the now-Closed Cambridge location).

I ordered the Hot Stone Bulgogi soup which was just average to me. Definitely had the sweetness of bulgogi but was lacking any depth. I did enjoy the glass noodles though and felt it could've used a little more tender meat and less scallions/veggies.

The Boy enjoyed his Spicy Pork BBQ but portions here are pretty small for the price. If you're going to pay this much, might as well go to Seoul Soulongtong where the portions are much larger for the same dollar and they have a few more authentic Korean offerings.",3.0

I'd originally had one ADR a day for our WDW trip, but we learned the hard way the obstacles of that is that, we're starving for the rest of the day until dinner time everyday. Plus the quick service options don't look that great. 

We were seated right away, and learned that walk-in waits took up to 40 minutes!

This was a huge restaurant with seating on two floors. Disney really did a good job with decorating and creating the ambiance for this restaurant. It is located in Asia in Animal Kingdom, and the vibe this place gave off, was a lodge near Mount Everest. It matched with the decor and style of the area for the standby line on Expedition Everest (best ride I've ever experienced on Disney property!).  There were brown chairs of different styles, some ornately carved, some simple. Lots of browns and red for the color scheme. And in front of us was a huge figure with a bird mask. That was my favorite part of the restaurant.  The restaurant was also pretty loud because it was packed. 

The service was so so. She politely came by to take our order and bring us our food, but it took forever for her to come by when we wanted a refill or we wanted to get our check. Meh. 

Hubby and I wanted to be really hungry for dinner so we ordered the duck dish to share. We're not big people, so one dish usually suffices for us to eat.  

When we got the dish, I thought it looked beautiful. The duck leg and thigh were a bright maroon color from the barbecue sauce. It was moist with crispy skin. The sauce was a tad too sweet though. It was served on a bed of rice, which I like because I can't live without that. There were some sauteed red peppers, carrots, mushrooms, onions and bokchoy. A bit soggy. They tasted like the frozen veggies you'd get at the store, and they only added bokchoy and fresh cilantro to make it more asian. 

Overall, this was a decent and filling dish, if not a bit pricey. Of course I say that in nearly all my reviews, especially if I don't think something was worth as much as how much I paid. 

Also, the straws here were pretty weird and made of paper, but I think they do that at AK so that if any animals came into contact with them, it wouldn't harm them.

So we arrive around 6:15. they say an hour and 15 minute wait. Being the Saturday before Valentines Day we expect everywhere else in the area to be this packed (save Village Inn, but seriously, it's a birthday party, not a field trip from the nursing home). So we wait. 45 minutes later we ask the time and they say we have an hour left. (Mistake!) So realizing we should be on the home stretch and still having an hour left made us quite agitated, especially seeing people who at least appeared to be just walking in and getting tables. 15 later they say we had 35 minutes left, then at 10-15 minutes from that they call us up. I remind know that we need a high chair (as we had said our party was 4 + a high chair)... OOPS! The table they had set out for us was not capable of taking a high chair... So after being called up we stand around for 15 more minutes. But this time it was around 7:30 so Jeffy was getting extremely agitated. For half of the 15 minutes Jeffrey was screaming. Finally we were sat down. 

Felling still extremely angry and very ready to go home and lambaste this place on here (yes, I do plan my yelp posts while eating). To our surprise, (and to the chagrin of my angry side) the waitress shows up after a mere 3 minutes. So my mom in a strange bit of conversation starting gives the waitress a recount of our seating debacle, in a strange semi-happy semi-angry manner. The waitress kinda gives an awkward reaction, takes our drink order and leaves. Later the manager comes by and apologizes and offers to get us ""the biggest appetizer on the menu."" Great. At a restaurant where the portions are already too big, more food isn't what we need. Either way we were still very pleased by the efforts to make us feel better. Later we learned that after our waitress got our drinks and listened to my mom's story she went straight to the manager and told him. 

By the time we left we were feeling ok, except for the usual question feeling in my insides. The question is ""when am I going to have to run to the restroom, and will I make it home?""

The negative is the towel dryers. I don't know how their tip jar fills up. They don't even wipe down the whole car, which ends up leaving streaks when you have driven for for a while.

3227,4yBL6zEgjW8qUJwFlaKZaQ,"This is an interesting experience if you are a tourist. The 8-minute, 4-D ride basically ""take"" you across Canada on a set of seats that make you feel like you are flying in the sky, high over the country. All in all, the experience of the ""flight"" itself was fun. But here is where they lost a couple of stars. 

The wait is long (even for October - low tourist season). But this is likely due to the fact that they don't fill you up in a large theatre.  Instead, every seat is a front row seat.  This puts a limit on how many visitors can be in each show.  

The picture quality was not as high as I had expected, given the technology available these days.  Initially, it feels ""cool"" to be flying over Canada, but after a while, the sensation disappears during the latter part of the show.   The one before the ride was probably not even necessary, as it was inferior is every way.  The picture AND sound quality were low. Even if you're standing, which most had to, one does not get that 360 feel. After about a minute into that segment, we realize there's not much need, or value, in rotating to see the other side of the room. 

This all brings to the price charged.  At $22 per person, this was not a cheap thrill.  When you have a family or a group, it adds up quickly.

We reluctantly ordered another round at the waitress' suggestion, as she said it'd cover it. Well, turns out we were still $3 short, and knowing I'd likely not be back here to use the deal at a later date, we paid for $3 worth of air. Awesome. 

I'm really leaning toward a 2 here due to the Deal issues, but I know that's not commonplace. Just be wary if you're planning on using one.",3.0

But the pho was good enough to ease my feelings, and it was served quite quickly as well. But then, when we were paying, the cashier was again very rude, snatching the money away and slamming it on the counter. We were quite startled and it left a bad aftertaste that erased the good mood. I'd recommend the place if you're just looking for decent pho for a cheap price, but if you want and overall pleasant experience, you might want to try somewhere else.",3.0

I do hate that you can't access The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but that's understandable, especially with the amount of alcohol that's flowing during this event.

The reason I'm only giving this two stars is how unfortunate the tickets are set up. If you don't get a fast pass, don't bother going.  We went on a THURSDAY at the beginning of October (nearly a month before Halloween). After paying nearly $100 per ticket, none of us wanted to pay the extra for fast pass figuring ""we'll just go do the most popular stuff first, and deal with the lines."" -- That's not how it works. If you don't get a fast pass, be prepared to feel like you've wasted your money. Out of our six hours in the park, I'd say we spent four of those waiting in line, fifteen minutes in attractions, and the rest of the time just wandering around drinking and admiring the scenery.

I should also note that there are so many people waiting to get in to attractions, that often the actors don't have time to reset the positions before the next group comes through, so you end up having certain ""scenes"" spoiled for you, and rarely end up getting scared.

I know the park is a huge business out to make money, but I can't help but feel like I was taken advantage of. What a let down.",2.0

I had my order within 2 minutes of sitting down: 6 oysters, a small cup of chowder, and a lobster roll.  The waitress asked how I would like them to come out - oysters first and the chowder and lobster together. 

The oysters were out and eaten by 12:55. They have a terrific selection of oysters to pick from.

The chowder came next. It was very good, but perhaps a very small amount. It did not come together with the roll unfortunately.

At around 1:30, the lobster roll came out. This seemed a bit excessive; The place did start to fill up AFTER I had arrived. The Lobster roll was good, not amazing.  The fries, pickles, and slaw, that came with them, very average - The fries being a bit too long in the fryer.

I'm not a Bostonite so I am unsure if the meal was costly.  The $60 meal was perhaps a bit high, but not horrible. The place was packed at 1:30 on a Monday afternoon so perhaps it is normal. However, I had the Lobster Roll at Legal Seafoods at Logan Airport last week and it was the same price($29), and was actually a bit better.

The restaurant had quite a bit of traffic for a Thursday evening which allowed for great people watching. If you are looking for an afterwork spot on a Thursday, this might be the place, hang out in the bar area.

Table service was very slow. I ordered the octopus again. Some pieces were over cooked and the burnt pieces were a bit of a turn off.  I still highly recommend the Octopus, however, ask that they do not over cook it!

However, our last several visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices, and we're at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant.  This has caused a great disturbance in the force!  Hard to imagine we'll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be.

Our visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general:  We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open, and one table was also vacant.  However, dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces, so no seating was available.  We sat on the waiting bench for 15 minutes (!) watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention.  Finally, one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes, and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter.  

When we sat down, my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped, and a lot of it.  The bits of rice were especially sticky, so it was hard to overlook, and once we glanced down, our appetites diminished.  It appeared that food had been accumulating all day, as it was a dirty mess underneath the table.  The supplies at the table itself were all out, aside from ginger and wasabi. The soy sauce was empty, no sauce dishes, and none at any adjacent places, either.  To her credit, one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements.  

That was the one bright spot, though:  Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly, and we had to ask where they were before they showed up.  The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day, at least judging by their manner, and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby--not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish!  When we paid, the waitress at the register didn't say a word, no smile or thank you, no word at all, and I felt bad about having left a tip.  We feel that servers should be treated generously, but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired!

On the whole, this was really not a good experience, and in keeping with each of our recent visits.

Though it carries the name, look, and amenities of a ""Grand Hyatt,"" this place appears to be set up to handle quantity...not quality.

The hotel was an official NCAA hotel during the Final Four and the rooms were very nice, the service divine, the food delicious, the garden was a nice touch, etc.  So why not give it 4 or 5 stars?  It was not safe.  The entire time we were there pick pockets, thieves, scalpers, and undesirables roamed freely through the hotel and the security staff did NOTHING about it even though it was happening blatantly in front of them.  I mean right in front of them.

While we were there we had all six of our NCAA Final Four tickets stolen, a friend had $600 robbed from her purse, and another friend had his wallet stolen.  When we approached security about this they called the police and took the steps needed to write a report but it was reactive not proactive.  We asked them why they were letting so many non-guests roam their hotel and the head of security snootily said, ""This isn't Wichita, KS.""  I travel for a living and have stayed in plenty of hotels as have every other member of our party...that statement was outright insulting and inappropriate.  In Kansas City the Intercontinental puts the hotel on lock down for Thanksgiving and the lighting of the plaza ceremony but the official NCAA Grand Hyatt in Atlanta can't?  I've stayed in the top 10 hotels around the world including the Oriental Bangkok...don't give me this ""Go back to Wichita Dorothy"" crap.

Scalpers hounded us in the entrance of the hotel with security standing feet away, they roamed the hallways, had access to the elevators, etc.  NOT SAFE.  That is why I am giving this hotel 1 star.  It is important to note that the front desk, concierge, room service, bar, cleaning, and all other staff members were phenomenal and becoming of what one would expect from a Grand Hyatt...but what is the point of luxurious amenities if you don't feel safe.  This hotel needs a new head of security, new security policies, and some serious apologizing before I would change my rating let alone consider staying there or even recommending it to anyone.  One of the major brands I work with is 2 blocks away and I can tell you we will not be using this hotel any time soon for our groups when they come to Atlanta.

My boyfriend and I both ate the same lunch and dinner, except I had a tuna roll at Shino, which he did not try. For breakfast I had oatmeal. Case in point, the tuna was to blame, and I am never going back there again. Not only that, but the scorpion roll was awful and the spicy chiken teriyaki roll was dry. I also ordered a salad and the lettuce was dirty and dry. I can't stand dry, dirty lettuce. I had a suspicious feeling when I looked at the sushi in the case. It looked a bit mucky and somehow a little unsanitary. Guess I won't be back for awhile.",1.0
3275,HvyQ_2tfWv4XkHj7Gy6zqQ,"Came here after reading all the reviews and was a bit disappointed. For eats, we ordered the now $2 burger (the avenue burger), sweet potato tots, wings (in the mind eraser and buffalo sauces), and fries. The burger was just ok - definitely no tasty burger, but good for the price. The sweet potato tots tasted burnt and was almost inedible. The wings were ok...the mind eraser sauce is made with ghost peppers and was pretty delicious, but as for the wing itself - I think Harry's fries up a better wing. The fries were good...definitely better than the tots.

As for drinks, I had the blueberry beer and my boyfriend had the allagash white and the shock top belgian white. He liked both of his beers, but my blueberry beer was just okay. The blueberry taste was really faint - the blueberry beer is a million times better at Harry's. Plus at Harry's they put real blueberries in your beer and the foam has blueberry bits in it. Call me snooty, but I like a bit of presentation and an actual blueberry taste to my blueberry beer.",3.0

IT WAS slow-motion DISGUSTING!  The bottle made contact with their finger before going back into a little fridge. Suffice it to say, it didn't stop me from carrying on with my order but i was pretty horrified. I had to get on my tippy toes to see the whole scene and I'm tall so... don't ...look?

The cashier experience is pleasant and informative and a fingerlicker served me when i couldn't get easily to the counter - the place is always in flux between packed and superpacked - and that gave me a wink of anxiety.

But the real reason for the 2-star review was a combination of stale bread and my blackened cod that tasted mostly of chili powder.  I like chili powder as an ingredient, but when it is the main flavor I don't care for it nearly as much.

My salad was fine and my wife's Fishwife Seafood Combo was tasty, so I know they aren't a complete loss.  I also suspect that if I'd gone for something more like Fish & Chips that I'd be more happy.

We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though.

Once we were able to order, our initial choices of champagne and wine were not available. They had NO champagne for some reason and the other two bottles of wine we wanted they were also out of. The waiter gave us a better bottle at the lower price of the previous bottles we had wanted. That was nice and much appreciated. They were also out of a couple of the entrees. When we inquired about the sides that came with the entree and which ones we should order in addition to it we were not properly informed. We ordered sides of asparagus when mine actually came with it to begin with. The salads as starters were just OK, nothing special. The entrees were fine, but once again, nothing to rave about. My friend ordered the surf and turf, very little surf and a whole lot of sauce with her turf. I had the lamb which was unfortunately the tiniest entree of lamb I have ever had in my life. Overall, the food tasted fine and luckily the Groupon compensated for the overpriced meal. It reminded us a lot of Vegas and how it is mainly all show that doesn't exceed or even meet your expectations. It was an ok-nice 'one-time experience' but both of us agreed that we would have no reason to ever go back. There are too many other places that are a much better value for your money.

I ordered two things a bacon poutine and a chicken club sandwich both were underwhelming and the service was poor.

Where to start..

False advertising, it is personal now!

When I order something that clearly states what it is like a BLT, I don't expect to get a roast beef on rye.

So when I order a BACON poutine, don't give me diced ham, bacon is a cured meat, ham is roasted, both can be smoked but they have very different flavours.

Gravy should not be thinner then water..

Fries should not be undercooked.

Sad that such a simple thing can go so wrong.

On to the chicken club sandwich, to make this sandwich look bigger they use a dinner role as a bun. The chicken nice and crispy but there was more breaking then chicken. Oh and did I mention the liberal sweet sweet mustard sauce that was all over this thing!

I picked up the sandwich and the bun was soaking in it, inside and out, I could not taste anything else but the sauce.

No where on the menu did it say anything about that sauce, and the server never asked me what I wanted or did not want on my sandwich.

And the final slap on the face, the two guys running the kitchen never even bothered to come out of the kitchen, it was too much for one of them to take my order at the front counter.

Our food came out slowly and was quite tasty but the amount of time between plates was borderline ridiculous. Then it was time for our entree. So we waited. Then we waited some more. Then I noticed the ladies next to us finished their plates that were right before their entrees. Then we waited some more. Did I mention we waited a while? Then I watched them serve the duck entree to the ladies next to us (yes they had ordered it as well). Then our waiter came over and said ""yeah...we accidentally served your entree to them, it will be a bit longer"". By the time our food came out, we were amazed at how hungry we were and how long it took. From start to finish, this meal clocked in at over 3 hours. Our entree was served to someone who came in after us, maybe because they were friendly with the bartender?

That rant aside, all 7 courses were tasty and we had no real complaints about the food part. The servings were tiny so spreading them out so much really wasn't enjoyable. There is no reason it should have taken so long and the pretentious feeling of the place really make us question if we would bother going back.",2.0

He was anxious to help me get what I needed on the day I needed it.  The website is easy to use to determine your needs and to place your order.  The boxes are great, very sturdy, it would be hard to break one.  The larger boxes could probably hold so much if you are not careful you'll never pick it up.   But I digress, it's rather inexpensive especially considering the fact there is delivery & pickup and you feel like all your items are in private storage locker when they are packed in the Bungoboxes.   I love it, and highly recommend it.  Just realize, you can probably only stack 5 or 6 filled boxes on a dolly.  So if you want items to remain boxed and on a dolly, you'll want multiple dollies.

It was my first service in the Fellowship Hall, with David preaching, and I have to say it was a wonderful experience. The kiddos had just had their Vacation Bible School and performed, it was adorable and sweet. The sermon was touching and thoughtful. The hymns lovely as well. The icing on the cake was a gentleman, Tim Curry (for real!), who performed ""Go Down Moses"" during the offertory. I would have paid good money to hear that man sing in a killer jazz bar. It moved me to tears. Please go at least to hear Tim sing. Good God. The people were super friendly, the childcare too. My daughter cried when it was time to leave.

I took away a star and gave it 4 stars because of the wait. If you decide to go around 6-8pm (any day of the week) be prepared for a WAIT! The line goes out the door, wraps around the building, and then some. The ordering/seating system is also a little confusing for first-timers, I can't even try and explain it, but be ready to be mildly confused if it's your first time there.

I also only gave it 4-stars because I don't know if I can give it 5-stars since the four times I've eaten there I've eaten the exact same burger... now, is that a bad thing? No, I think it might say a lot for Hopdoddy's since I'm so in love with this burger I can't even try other burgers. GREEK BURGER is where it's at. I'm a fan of Greek food in general, and to combine Greek + Burger into one beautiful mash-up? Heavenly. 

So I don't know if that gives me the right to properly review this place. I think the problem with this place is that each burger is so good in its own right, once you try one burger, you can't stop eating that same burger... my boyfriend did the same thing with the Terlingua. He got it the first time, and the next two times he went, the burger was just so good he couldn't even bother try any of the others!

The boyfriend is in love with the Kennemec (spelling?) fries. Me? I think they aight! Sometimes they're really salty, and sometimes they're just perfect. I think the herb-y stuff they sprinkle on the fries makes it really stand out from other fries at burger places. 

I suggest if you go here, you go at like 5-5:30PM to beat the rush. And try and go in a big group and have everyone get different burgers, that way you have the opportunity to take a bite into other burgers to try them out. Don't be like me... stuck with the same delicious burger each time I go... woe is me!",4.0

I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole, despite all the horrible reviews about this place; I decided to open a new a membership.
 I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building 80 hours + so I scheduled an appointment and didn't get Nicole, I booked on the same day with a diff person - I went in excited, however this time not even minutes of my facial; the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning , she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution. After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead.

I have read reviews calling it overpriced but find it to be quite the opposite.  In fact, for my last visit we had a $25 Restaurant.com voucher and also went on Tuesday when $30-90 dollar bottles of wine are 50% off.  I went with three others, ordered multiple apps including curried mussels, six different dinner dishes, several orders of Naan, several mixed drinks and a $85 bottle of wine.  The bill was only $108 ($118 if you include the voucher cost).  If you can't handle $30 per person for a nice multi-course meal, drinks and good wine, go to the Masala Wok.

3336,lkz6jxGQZYXv3V65V-QFZg,"This review is solely about the breakfast service.

I used to come here every weekday morning for breakfast tacos and coffee on my way to work. A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift, and since then the service at breakfast has declined sharply. 

The guy who used to run the counter at breakfast was cheerful, courteous, and FAST. There were plenty of all the different types of tacos wrapped and ready to go, and I could grab my coffee, choose my tacos, pay and leave in less than five minutes, usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet.

The first time I went since that guy left, there were two new guys, one running the counter and the other preparing the tacos. Both of the kinds I usually get weren't ready, and the taco prepper took a while to make the tacos, then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready. I stood there for several minutes until the cashier noticed the bag sitting there, even after I told him they were ready and had been set down. 

The last time I went there, there was only one customer ahead of me in line, who looked tense and irate, waiting for the same ""taco prepper"" guy from the previous time to fix his tacos (he usually wears a bandana on his head). This time he was also running the register. I got my coffee, waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid.

The guy came and took my order, started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my tacos. Then he asked me if I was okay (I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed), and I told him I was just in a rush. Then he loudly said that they're never in a rush at Live Oak Market, and I told him that they used to be, and that I used to be able to get my order quickly. He told me to have a nice day, and I left. 

I've worked in customer service for years, including working as a barista at a busy coffee shop, and I find the notion that ""rushing"" during what is known as ""rush hour"" on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable. The primary reason people stop there is because, yes, the tacos are good and so is the coffee, supporting local businesses is important, AND because you can jump out of your car, grab your food and coffee, and get back on the road in five minutes or less (or you should be able to, rather). If you're not prepared to ""rush"" between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m. on a weekday, and you're serving breakfast and coffee, then you're in the wrong business.

Luckily, a family owned taco truck opened directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot. Their tacos are less expensive, taste much better, the staff is friendly, and they're always ready when you get there. So, no more Live Oak for me in the mornings. I make my own coffee and get tacos across the street. 

(During the rest of the day, the staff is great, and I still love the store in general, but I hope they replace their early morning staff.)",1.0

3345,b0zWsjLuj1za3rPXW0p3PA,"Let me start out with that this Petco is not every Petco. I am a tourist from Ohio and was only in Georgia for a few days and the Petco I normally go too is fantastic with knowledgeable staff that take great care of their animals (not just the fuzzy ones but the scales and finned ones too). This is the opposite of that place. So I stopped by just to see what a pet store this far from home has to offer. I love reptiles and fish and it is fun to see what everyone has and my reptile room has room for new tanks if I see a good deal on a reptile I want. I went in excited and ended up horrified at what I saw and witnessed from staff. The tanks were old which isn't the staffs fault and not a big deal I have seen old tanks like this taken care of well and look nice but they clearly didn't care to care about these tanks, algae and cyanobacteria abound with some tanks having incompatible fish shoved together. The icing came when I was at salt water and overheard the employee telling two customers that the fish they were looking at were damsels and I happen to look and see two SAILFIN TANGS! Not everyone may know salt water fish but there is a big difference between a tang and a damsel with the tang growing way way bigger. So what does someone do who knows more and can save a fish from being put into an improper home and saving a fishkeeper who doesn't know better a heartache? Politely point out that those aren't damsels but sailfin tangs and that get much bigger than a damsel would. And what does the employee do you wonder? Admits they aren't sure, maybe ask why I say that so they can learn and see what I see? Nope! She starts arguing with me very rudely! Says they are clearly and definitely damsels! So this back and forth continues and it starts to get heated and I'm at the point of pulling out my phone to show her what a sailfin tang looks like she can't deny it any more but my boyfriend pulls me away. I go to cool off a bit by going to the reptiles and hope the customers at least listen to me, especially since I said how I have been doing salt water and fish in general for years. What do I find? Not many reptiles those who are there being cared for, barely. I see leopard geckos and say how cute they are and the girl caring for them says that are weird and pulls one from under the carpet (which is a natural behavior) and proceeds to not set it down nicely but just tosses it. It is a living being for goodness sakes! Treat the poor thing with some care, even if you personally don't like it! I go back over to fish getting more and more disgusted with this place to find those customer getting both of the 'damsels' when tangs are very aggressive with the same species of tang. The employee comes back and says that 'other customer' (me) was right they are tangs and not damsels. And admits then that she knows little to nothing about salt water. Then why argue with me when I say how long I have been keeping aquariums? Why be selling animals you know nothing about?! This store disgusts me and makes me appreciate the one back home where the employees care and try to be as knowledgeable as possible for the sake of the animals. Petco, pay your people more so maybe they will care, hire people who care, or train them better (or better yet all three!) because this is why you get a bad name.",1.0

However I think it is time I move on to other car wash options. Today I received ""The Works"" car wash, which is the one option of the three I always choose. It's like ""good, better, best"" and this is the best wash you can purchase from them.

I had some dried up bird droppings on my windshield. Ran it through ""The Works"" and after the wash was competed, there were still a large amount of remnants. I went back to the front entrance and the employees didn't even bat an eye knowingly exactly why I came back for round two. They asked me to sign a piece of paper and allowed to receive ""The Works"" again. After the second run, there was still residue bird droppings left on my windshield.

I soon saw why as there's really only a few tables in the long narrow space.

I like how the menu had a wide selection of breakfast selection, and the 3 of us each ordered a dish. 

I had this (straight from their online menu):
Saumon Fume (served all day)
Open faced ciabatta sandwich. Fried egg, smoked salmon, caper cream cheese, sliced avocado, arrugula pepperdew and artichoke salad.

It was quite good! Cream cheese with the capers were a perfect pair, it would've been a bit healthier if there was less oil and salt. But overall, it was great. I would order that again.

My friends had:

Fricassé (served all day)
2 fried eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, arugula, applewood cheddar. Grilled foccacia.
- She said it was quite good, served in a pan

l'Omlette du Matin
Daily selection of seasonal ingredients.
- She said it was good as the beginning, but the flavours got too heavy and she couldn't even finish it.

3394,n2iBSRk3R-D3CJ1bbLozEg,"My husband and I have been pleased with hooters wings and had pretty decent service at the last hooters we went to. This one I must say was pretty bad. We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them. This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started. 

Our server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time. Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs. I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens, especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood.

After we ordered our meal, it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook, I could understand. People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up. We finished our meal within 15 minutes and never heard from our server again.

After waiting for the check for about 15 minutes, I figured she might have thought we were still eating...I'm not sure. So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table. We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check. This never happened. 

After another 15 minutes, I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around. The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about 10 minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next. This never happened.

Within the NEXT 15 minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours, then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us, there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him: Bending over real far to wipe the table, sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him, and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here 10 feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for 45 minutes now. After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay.

She ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back. I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys. I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them. What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock. Not acceptable. I've never given any server under 10% for service even if it was pretty bad until now. If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time.",1.0

When we passed by this trendy yet spacious shop, we were naturally intrigued. There was a polar bear in a ski cap and ice cream pop art on the wall (photo: http://bit.ly/2ujpQ7l).

They had chocolate and vanilla, but of course, it had to be Valrhona Chocolate and Madagascar Vanilla. What was more intriguing to us were the two non-dairy froyo options that were apparently made from almond milk. Something sweet before dinner couldn't hurt, right? Jamie went for the Hazelnut Praline which for a small $3.95 cup, was a generously tall serving (photo: http://bit.ly/2KKa1BF). That meant I had to get a small cup of the Vanilla Latte which plopped over in pure exhaustion from the spigot (photo: http://bit.ly/2KVvBTc). Refreshing and not too sweet.

First of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'

I ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way.

After a few months I decided to give them another chance. And that's when they grabbed my money off the table before I finished counting. That's the last straw.

3401,Lc0phrGowrUGpSr5zP9Sbw,"Went here for lunch today. 

My mouth fell open... and hit the floor... when I saw the cheap prices. How is this possible? So naturally, I assume it's going to suck and be small. Oh but wait, it's actually yummy and nice portions! 

So the 4 stars is more for what you get with your money. Had these items been slightly more expensive, the review would definitely be 3 stars. But major kudos for keeping the prices cheap. 

Mixed Green Salad - Small $2.95 / Large $3.95
selection of mixed greens topped with peppers, tomato, onion, mushrooms & cucumber
- so we got the large, and it was actually.... LARGE.

Mozzarella Sticks - $4.95
deep fried cheese sticks topped with parmesan cheese, served with marinara sauce
- So these were my least favorite, and I prob wouldn't order these again.
-Just to note, the parmesan cheese didnt really taste like parmesan cheese.. prob the cheap kind (but how picky can we be for $5?) 
- Different tasting fried batter... not sure if I love it or hate it, haha.

Tuna Wrap - $6.95 
fresh tuna salad with lettuce, tomato & onion in a fresh tortilla wrap
- They don't have whole wheat wraps :( But once again, for $7, how much can you complain? 
-It hit the spot
-Fries were surprisingly awesome. Thick cut fries, good fry on them.

3402,JJIMeA3DfKdOsS8rxOP7PQ,"This is my first experience with the Austin Rodeo, but not my first rodeo. Growing up in San Antonio meant the rodeo fairgrounds were a ""must"" on every adolescent's list. The Austin rodeo seems much smaller than the SA one but still worth the price of admission (cheap seats were $35, a lot less if you're only wanting to go to the fairgrounds) if you get to see an icon like Willie Nelson and cheer for the calves you're hoping won't get roped (why is this still a thing? In fact, one could question why the rodeo is still a thing, but when in Rome..) 

Parking: $10 and some serious, albeit necessary, control freaks directing where you should park. I would suggest carpooling.

Food: We missed the bbq competition by a week but managed to find our share of good fried food. The smoked turkey legs were yummy and could feed a small family; the bratwurst with sauerkraut was pretty good (I grew up in Deutschland, so I'm pretty particular) and the funnel cake was huge-- three of us barely finished it. 
 
Rides: lots of scary rides to ride but alas, we did not ride the scary rides this time.

Rodeo: This portion lasts 2 hours, the music for about an hour. The calf-ropin' makes me cringe and I could do without, but I enjoyed the barrel raising. I also liked the bull and horse riding but I do wonder what the cowfolks do to piss them off so. After watching Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, I couldn't help but wonder what other shenanigans go on backstage. 

Music: Willie and his family put on a good show. I love me some Willie (yes, that's what she said) but with the exception of a few tunes, he seemed to say the words more than sing them, as if he were reading poetry set to music. His son belted out a SRV tune, which I did not expect. Still, I hope Willie was just not feeling great that night. He has such a unique singing voice. Nonetheless, I'm so glad I went. My first concert ever was a Willie Nelson show with my family 35 years ago. I did not want to go way back then because I thought I was a lot more rock than country and so I pretended to hate it, but am secretly glad my parents made me go. 

Currency: bring cash. Most of the vendors require tokens but take it from me and don't overbuy tokens for food or you'll end up trying to use them up by buying lots of water on your way out.  Beers cost $7 (they will take cash or tokens at the ""bar"").",3.0

But I thought it was bad that they had ran out of stuff we didn't order like lemonade and coke but then when I ordered it they were out of okra to be fried. So I was disappointed! The cornbread you can pass on. It was dry and reminded me of that box cornbread mix from Martha White. The banana pudding they gave us free was gross; too sweet and taste mostly like bananas just mashed up. The fried fish whiting was cooked very well. The seasoning and batter used was good. Collard greens good. Potato salad was gross. Blackeyed peas were good.  Overall it was an experience and I would return for that fish.,2.0
3409,dJYJ6S4iM6U3tv8HlwgIiw,"I had about 6 cleanings with 2 different professionals. Overall, it was nice to have a cleaning service, but I never full felt satisfied with the experience. The Handy Pros were usually late, sometimes came unprepared with supplies and used mine instead,and one walked off with some of my cleaning supplies. One Pro brought her daughter to my apartment with her and while it wasn't a big deal, it was definitely awkward -- her mom even had her help clean at one point. I understand things come up, babysitters cancel at the last minute, but don't bring your daughter to work and force her to do your job either. It's not right.

I gave feedback to the company and did receive a $29 credit, so I gave the service one last shot but experienced the same issues. 'Professional' showed up late, came unprepared, and used my supplies without asking. 

The company makes it difficult to cancel your services entirely. You can only cancel each appointment at a time on the site, and the next is automatically scheduled and billed. If you need to cancel entirely, you need to call their customer service line and deep in the options you can get a hold of someone to actually talk to.

Bottom line, great concept but not worth it.",2.0

Apparently they sat a party of 60 who were a half an hour late to their reservation. This pushed everything back over an hour. We finally got the manger to seat us an hour later and were unfortunately in the same room as the large party. Our service was as good as it could have been. They did comp up some drinks and food (it was still frozen!!). I was upset with the way the reservations were handled. We were there to have a good time and relax and it was stressful.

But somewhere along the way, Qdoba lost it's way and things just aren't the same anymore. Most of the workers there seem incompetent. The food is continually getting more expensive, and the food isn't as fresh as it used to be. It is a bit pricey considering you can get a massive wrap over at Boloco that tastes better and is bigger for less. Qdoba does have some pretty good nachos, but in the Southern US you get these for free with your meal, which really sours the deal here.

The service was slow, and by the time our food came around, I practically inhaled my lobster roll and ended up picking off food from my family. If you want a good lobster roll, you're better off going to Pauli's. But, the experience of doing the whole crab-cracking-wearing-a-bib was fun.",3.0

Pluses: nice variety of hot and cold sandwiches, usually big, reasonably priced (but increasing of late). If you stick with the traditional deli fare (reuben, etc.) , you're solidly in four-star territory. The vintage board games are a nice quirk, the soda fountain selection avoids the usual Pepsicoke products, and the staff seem pretty nice.

Other things I like less. The soups are so-so (the tomato bisque is pretty ho-hum). The sandwich breads and burger buns are often bagged and pre-sliced affairs, a big downer for me. The salmon burger's curiously regular shape seems to indicate pre-made or boxed origins. To sum, wandering away from the more conventional deli offerings seems like an exercise in diminishing returns. 

I'll be back, as I'm invariably hungry and in the mood for a nearby sandwich, and you should probably check it out to see if NWD is your style, but a little more thought and  love could take the menu to a higher level.",3.0
3429,TTtxkjKJQUTOb7gyxXCzpA,"Where to start... hmmmmm. 
FD's Grillhouse was Amazing!  Great atmosphere, great prices, and great staff!

We showed up around 6pm; just before the dinner rush. It was quiet and we were sat pretty quickly. Our waitress came up and was nice and quirky.  She gave us input and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. She took our order and within 10 min we had our side salads. We actually had our salads before we received our drinks! 

My Fiancé and I both ordered the ""pick 3."" (best deal in my opinion) She had the Grilled Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, and Fried Catfish. Shrimp was really good. Big and delicious! (Her words, not mines)  The salmon was so good!  It was kind dry, but a little lemon made the whole salmon taste amazing! Lastly was the catfish. No fishy after taste and was fried to perfection! Her sides were a side salad with Lemon Herb & Vinaigrette. (Absolutely amazing dressing if you don't like ranch) She also had steamed broccoli they were good. Just steamed broccoli...

For my 3, I chose the Atlantic Salmon, Crawfish Étouffée, and Fried Catfish. I'll start with my sides. I had the Red Beans and Rice. It was okay. Sadly I think Popeye's makes it better. I upsized my side and got a cup of Gumbo. A little spicy for me but it was too good to not eat all of it! Very filling too! A bowl of that would probably fill me up.  
The Salmon was good. Again, a little dry but a little lemon juice put it over the top!  The Crawfish Étouffée was scrumptious! It doesn't looks like much, but the rice will fill you up before you realize it. Lastly was the Fried Catfish. It was great! Cooked to perfection! Had some ketchup and some lemon. I had to take a fillet home with me. (That's right a 325 lb. man couldn't finish his plate.) That's how generous the portions are!

For an appetizer we had the Fried Calamari. My Fiancé loves it here because it doesn't taste like you are eating grease. It was good but didn't WOW me. In my opinion it was a little chewy. I like my Calamari to be a little crunchier. Great taste though! I would definitely order them again. 

There is one innovative item they have that I can't go without mentioning. It's this lemon net they have for when you squeeze the lemon onto your seafood. It kept the seeds in, and you didn't have lemon juice spray everywhere. Instead it made a controlled flow for the lemon juice to be spread evenly. It change my life! I'm never letting citrus fruit spray anyone around me ever again! 

All in All I would rate this place with 4 Stars. Beer and wine selection isn't the greatest. It did get a little noisy during the rush hour (I know I'm being a uppity about a little noise) and for a Friday I felt they were under staffed. 
The reason I am giving a 5 star review is because of our waitress Patience (that's her actual name) was freakin awesome! Attentive and fast. Didn't matter she was overwhelmed. She kept a great attitude and made our experience memorable. 
Patience if you end up reading this. You were awesome! If I weren't ballin on a budget I would have give more then 25%.  If I ever go back, I can only hope to get you again.",5.0

In the end, I still wanted to dye my hair pearl white. Note that I have black, Korean hair about as dark as it gets. I ended up bleaching my hair three times before dying it and it looks amazing! This was done 2 weeks ago and it surprisingly still looks super good. My hair doesn't feel damaged and I get complements for it all the time. Oh, and the cut?

Try their BBQ pork, Chaxaw pork, BBQ cuttlefish, crispy skin pork, and the dishes they have written on the menu on the wall.  The flavor is great, just like Chen's down the street.  Place is small so I usually just do take out and eat at home but the flavor is not the same as if you dine in since they do something to the dish in the back (adding different type of sauces) which make the food taste batter (plus they heat it up).  Try the noodles and wontons also, it's pretty good, but I rather have other type of noodles instead of yellow egg noodles).  

If you like Chinese food and want something different than typical take out places then this is the one you have to try!",5.0
3453,kRTH_f9eiccXL38zomifLQ,I wanted to write a review on this little Gem in Winthrop.  I have been going here for about 2 years now and have always been pleased with their talant.  I first started coming to this Nail Salon after I had a disaster of a Nail Job done the day of my wedding at a Nail Salon at Square One Mall.  I now have learned the hard way that you never get your nails done in a Mall (Especially for a big event) because they want to take in as many customers as possible they do not care how the end result looks.  I left the Mall so disappointed and on my way home I decided to see if any of the Local Nail Salons near my house could help me.  The first place I went to could not help because they said it would be too much work to undo what the other place had done.. I decided to try one more place and Thank Goodness I stumbled across A & V Nails Salon.  The Ladies their helped me redo the nails that were done at the Mall and Did a fantastic Job.  I knew It being my Wedding day that my hands were going to be photographed so I can not thank them enough for  their help.  I have been going there for Business ever since.  The staff there is very personable and they remember me everytime I come in the door.  They are all very talanted and hard workers.  If you are close to the area and need a good mani or Pedi I totally recommend trying them out.,5.0

Food looked good on the plates of others thru the window, so we entered.  3 hostesses at the entrance.  Got seated immediately.  After about 20 mins, there was no visible wait staff - while the hostesses chatted it up.  The manager finally comes over after busing a table with dirty dishes in one hand to take our drink order.  Our overworked, bubbly waitress eventually surfaces to take our food order.  Food is served and we dig in.   Ketchup requested at the onset is not delivered until omelet is halfway consumed.  No raw sugar for the coffee.  Grit croutons served with the Caesar Salad - WTF?  Several little things prevent this spot from being top notch.  But ""its the little things that count"", right?

3460,MuxsqUzLzq21uEVkeM5EQQ,"I'd like to give Clark Lewis 3.5 stars. So, I will err on the side of more rather than less.

That being said, we were there with a group of 8 on a Saturday night. Great set-up and sweet to be accommodated. Allow me to set the mood: the night was hot. It was a scorcher. The room large with beautiful dividers made of wood and bubbly glass. Lighting was romantic. Garage doors that open into the night air... but those doors being open on night like this last Saturday was not too terribly enjoyable. In one word: SWEEEAAATTTYY. The wood chairs do not help that situation one bit.

The wine selection was pretty good - not too much in the way of entry-level choices though. There are SO many good cheap wines out there that I'd like to see at least a couple available. Okay, granted, I am going to drop a good $50 on dinner... so I guess that it just comes with the entire package - but I'd still like to have a good wine to drink while I'm waiting that doesn't cost a million dollars.

The food was great. I had the beat salad and the halibut. The beet salad was awesome because it had goat cheese on it... and quite frankly you can top a pile of crap with goat cheese and I'll probably like it. The best part about that is that the goat cheese was PILED on there. Yeah, baby... just the way I like it. The halibut was cooked to perfection. Moist and the flavors were fresh and clean. Really a great dish for keeping it light so that I could finish it off with the dark chocolate mousse. Did you say dark chocolate mousse? Oh, yes I did... and it is GOOD.

The waiter was VERY average, and that is, in my opinion, a HUGE downer in a place like this. I mean, I'm dropping some serious cash on dinner - please send me a waiter that has got his shit together. He was knowledgeable about the wine/beer/food, but didn't get me a refill on the coffee when he gave everyone else one. Also when we showed up (after everyone else already had a drink), he didn't come over to find out if we wanted a drink. Um, yo - what are you doing, dude?

They switch up the menu often, and they also do a Prix Fixe menu for $56. Seems like that'd be the way to go if your group were up for it. Overall good experience... but I needed a better waiter and some reasonably-priced wine selections. Then it would have been top notch.",4.0

Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. 

I went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a ""must go"" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)

They did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.

The only thing that could have improved that view is if they had had chairs out on the balcony.  It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  

The hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  

This hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  

The WiFi was slow but free.  

Don't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.

The menu was boring, food looked tired and tasted dry. The red flannel hash in particular should be sent back to the drawing board. Big chunks of undercooked  cold potato and tough meat with a helping of watery sour beets stuck on top as though each ingredient had been shoveled out of a separate tupperware container. Noticed a few patrons looking at it equally skeptically. The dad had one of the eggs benedict concoctions and the poached eggs were hard. Only daughter who had the burger was happy, but at $35 one might hope so. The fruit tart was nice but not special, the chocolate tart a big hunk-a-dry chocolate on a pastry base. Service was gracious as usual, but not enough to make up for expensive dire food.  Won't be back I'm afraid.",2.0

The menu looks fantastic - lots of options, some standard and some unique.  and the food is well presented.  the taste and quality, however, leave much to be desired.  overall, i'd say, the experience was inconsistent.

I ordered the Nicoise salad and the tuna was sort of stringy - i couldn't cut it with the butter knife i was given and it felt strange to request a steak knife for tuna.  and the whole salad left an oily sort of mark on the plate at the end.

my fiance had the Campbell, and absolutely loved it.

the ambiance was predictable for an American casual restaurant.  It was a nice Boston evening, so the patio had a 1 hour wait and we decided to sit inside.  It is a relatively small place, but we had plenty of space.

Finally, after 5 minutes, the greedy server came around to take our drink order, some of us order iced water, some coke, and sprite, and my son order a lemonade, which after 3 minutes, she told us they where out of.  She offered him either a coke or sprite, which he rejected, and asked instead for a glass with iced water.  After 5 minutes, SURPRISE, he had a lemonade on the table, or at least looked as one, but no it was a flavorless glass of water with lots of sugar in it. Now, going to the food, dumplings were delicious, eggroll tasted like frozen food boxed one, sweet and sour pork was crappy, crispy beef was great, walnut shrimp was ok, about a B+, chowmein and fried rice were lousy, flavorless and warm, not hot as they should.  When the check came, I don't understand why they impose you a 18-20% tip already included on your bill.  I don't know if you agree with me, but why should you tip that much for service that was bad, and when the server doesn't do a good job according to your expectations and in turn tries to push items that increase your check, so that she can pump up her 20% tip that she didn't deserve.  Tips are deserved with the quality of your service: terrible service = no tip, bad service = no more than 10%, ok service = upto 15%, great service = 18% up to no limit.  Again, tips are worked for, not imposed.

The tonkotsu ramen was absolutely delicious, savory not overly salty. I ended up finishing the entire bowl. Each table has  a chilli oil bottle, and a spice bottle as condiments if you choose to flavor up your food. 

The gyoza was a good balance between vegetables and meat, it was accompanied with soy sauce. It wasn't as flavorful as I would like it but it certainly wasn't bad. 

The takoyaki balls were good for their price--the presentation was beautiful. Each ball was stuffed with a generous amount of chopped octopus. I wish it was cooked a little longer for the inside was a bit too mushy for me, but don't get me wrong, with the sauces and bonito and seaweed flakes it was plenty flavorful.

I didn't know hair salons even did stuff like that. It wasn't bad, but I would have appreciated a heads-up. He should have said, ""Hey, I'm about to give you a vigorous scalp massage. Hold on to your britches."" Instead, it was a surprise, so it was awkward.
I showed him a picture of what I wanted. He cut my hair a little bit shorter than I would have liked, but that's not a huge deal as long as the layers line up correctly. I made the mistake of saying I like it curly-- cause I do, but most hairdressers think that means they can take a round brush and make you look like a juvenile beauty pageant contestant.

3541,xB5LfoP0upRRCsoYohDOrA,"I accompanied my husband to Orlando for Cisco Live. We chose the Peabody due to its close proximity to the convention center (the most convenient location) and stayed here from a Sat to a Fri. We arrived extremely early on Saturday and luckily they had an available room for us. I wasn't a fan of the smaller room (and I'd be the one hanging out in it the most) so we upgraded a notch and got a larger room in the Mallard Tower. It was very spacious with a separate seating area and a vanity for me! Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a/c not working so well, I didn't like the size/layout of the room. We decided our current room was better. We had another minor glitch in that our fridge was not working, but that was fixed by giving us another working fridge in the room.

Should I need to return to Orlando to be near the convention center, I would stay here again. The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice! Really made our hotel stay and minor blips easy to get over. Although I wish the rooms had coffee makers. Another plus are those like me who do not have children. Luckily, there are two pools. The grotto pool is the huge one w/ the waterfall close to the parking structure. The quieter lap pool is also large and catered more towards adults. I loved this area. While the husband was in his classes, I was relaxing by the pool. More hotels need two pool areas like the Peabody. I also got to check out the lovely fitness center (didn't use it), and used the spa twice. Wish the spa was larger with a hot sauna as well as the steam sauna.

Peabody also has a few restaurants. I recommend Napa for lunch and dinners. B-Line Grill was gross and Capriccio not very good either. I also recommend self-park. I'm normally a valet girl b/c I'm lazy, but every time we valeted, it was backed up and took forever for our car to come out.

Original Review:
So foodies this place would get 3 and a half stars from me. They have some delist food and some interesting choices.  I had the big nasty and it was decadent and fattens beyond belief. I could not finish and had to bring half of it home. So as far as my meal, it was very good.

The drinks sounded good - interesting.  I had the cherry limeade and my friend ordered something  I now can't remember. It was really mediocre and I didn't finish it. Watered down and not flavorful. 

The worst part of our experience was hands down the service. Please note this: Rosebud does no substitutions. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. Forget that breakfast is usually the easiest meal to custom make- that often they take 2 minutes to cook eggs and make it to order.  Forget the fact that my friend was a vegetarian. They will not make any substitutions.  When my friend begged them to leave the bacon off at they would not. When she asked for tomatoes instead, they said she could order them on the side for 3.95.  3.95??? And that is what she did and they literally gave her a saucer with tomatoes.  

On top of this our waitress was soooo rude about it.  Terrible.  I mean it was unusual - I have never been to a restaurant that refused to make any substitutions for breakfast  and her attitude towards my friend was almost as bad as, ""well, you shouldn't be a vegetarian."" Despite my food being good, I haven't gone back and I'm not sure i will. Lots of good breakfast in Atlanta- no one should feel like a criminal for not eating meat.",2.0

They do have gluten free crust options as well as thin crust, original, pan, stuffed, etc.  The pizza is deliciously fresh and you simply pop it in the oven and bake! Perfecto!  It is WAY better in quality then any of the other take out pizza places in town. This location is extremely generous with the toppings, so go crazy! I also like that they have ""gourmet"" toppings like artichoke hearts and kalamata olives.  They also have ready made salads that are great lunch options.  Everything's been delicious and they always hand out discounts and coupons to keep us coming back. Love it.",5.0
3546,ALUE1wAi0wx2TF5zoIWtPg,"There are two kinds of people in this world: those who wear white with complete confidence, and then there's the rest of us, who have to make an ACTIVE effort not to look like a an 7 year-old spattered with random shmutz by the end of the day. I, being a member of the latter team (read: clumsy), did not do well here. In my defense, it was my first time. 

A little background first. Personal shortcoming- I suck at chopsticks. I can play piano, paint fine detail, french braid hair, write in fancy scripts, yet somehow I haven't mastered the ability to grasp rice with two sticks. Eating here at Kaze was like every embarrassing chopstick failure I've ever had, but amped up to the Nth degree. Basically, I found myself trying to skewer what appeared to me to be raw cold cuts, cooking it in boiling broth, losing the coldcut in the broth 3 or 4 times, overcooking it while frantically trying to fish it out, and quickly shoving it into my mouth, with broth gracefully running down my ladylike chin. Awesome. The payoff, in terms of tastiness, was not comparable to the effort it required, IMHO.

My dining companion, who was attempting to explain protocol, was appalled. He had to remind me several times not to use the same utensil that I originally picked the raw cold cut up with. Okay, so I suck. I suck at chopsticks, I suck at Shabu Shabu, and I suck at life. 

Truth be told, I just wasn't into it. I don't see myself trying this again.

This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible. My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events. After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive, I ordered a cocktail that took about 15 minutes to arrive and it also took me asking (literally) 5 times to receive a glass of water. I'm pretty sure this was our server's first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things. We ordered 2 appetizers, the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip. The trout dip was tolerable, but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor. The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise. Then came the entrees... which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order. His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular. My barramuni was inedible. I don't know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry. Not only that, it was completely unseasoned, but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper. The fish was supposed to come with quinoa, squash and green beans. Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash. This wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't taken so long for our server to check on our dishes, and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner. Instead we had to yet again flag down our server, and then when he seemed confused about what to do, we had to ask him to send over the manager. Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent $50 on such a disappointing experience.",1.0

I ordered a steak tip salad which I order a lot of from different places and this one is the worst by far, first of the tips where frozen cold which is disgusting. Second I got cooked peppers in a salad with no cucumbers, I went home and added cucumbers .... then the Italian Calzone had nothing but cheese inside, and it tasted horrible. The French fries and the fried chicken tasted like a fried Egg.... Hi hello clean the oil it's old. It was a waste of my money and if I could give it no stars I would.

Lastly they wanted to over charge me and when I questioned it I got an attitude for it... we walked into all burning smoke air and it took another 10mins to get my order that they told me would be ready in 20mins.

The host greeted us, not by saying ""welcome to BJs,"" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. 

The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.

Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. 

I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. 

Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.

Anyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalapeño burger, which came with fried jalapeños. The burger had only a couple of jalapeños, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.

The venue is rather small. Two rooms separated by an archway. I went on a Saturday night around midnight, paying the $10 cover charge at the door. The ambience is very urban. Rap music floods the venue from the small DJ booth in the corner by the bar. After waiting nearly five minutes at the bar, I paid for 2 Heineken's at $6 a piece, before walking around to find a seat. But there wasn't any. Packed with well over 50 people, seating was only enough to hold about 20 and was primarily for hookah users. The booths which lined the wall costs $350, which to be honest is about $275 too much. I left after only spending 20 minutes inside.

Mississippi recently, killing time before a happy hour meet up with some friends, and happened across CD-Game Exchange, so I decided to stop in and browse for a few. The place impressed me quite a bit, and I'll always try to go back and search the racks for a cheap find anytime I'm back in the neighborhood.

I've seen other CD-Game Exchange locations around Portland, and a long time ago I stopped into the Hawthorne location but failed to find the specific discs I was looking for. I think this location on Mississippi is similar in that you probably shouldn't go looking for one specific disc, artist, or game - this is no Everyday Music or Music Millennium.

But if you're just browsing, it's definitely worth checking them out because they do have a pretty decent selection of used CDs, at really reasonable prices. They have a decent selection of discs priced in the $1-5 range, and more priced a few bucks higher. And the bargain priced discs aren't all from bands of which you've never heard or never want to hear.I managed to score a copy of ""Honey, I'm Homely"" by the Dance Hall Crashers for only $1[!] and it plays just fine.

I'm not really a gamer these days, so I didn't look at their selection or pricing of video games, but if it's anything like their CD inventory it's worth checking out.

They have a fair return/buy-back policy which diminishes a little each day you have the CD or game, so if you have a little buyer's remorse you're not completely out of luck.

As I say, it's not the best place to go searching for that one special CD, but they have enough stuff for you to browse and likely find something you want at very reasonable prices.",4.0

The foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. 
After unpacking--which I shouldn't have done, but I'm a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. 
Shortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn't ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. 
Long story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.

Once we got our drinks, the bartender walked around to the outside of the bar and sat down, not getting up the whole time to check and see if we needed anything, etc. I had to signal her over from across the bar to ask for our check. From there, it went further downhill...My legal name is William, but I everyone usually knows that Bill is short for or a nickname for William...like Joe for Joseph, or Bob for Robert, Dick for Richard, etc. Well, they wouldn't accept my Visa card because my license shows William and my cc shows Bill. In all my years, I have never had an issue of my card getting rejected...and I mean never!! I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company...this guy didn't have a clue, nor did he care one bit. I then pulled out my AMEX, which did have William listed, but the bartender then stated they don't even take AMEX. After all that, I just ended up paying cash, but this was in my mind terrible customer service!

3616,vmdZ24Us8xE5ddWJQJ2Pdg,"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.

The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  
The hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  
The burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  
The place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  
I did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  
There is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. 
The front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.  This location might not be accessible to handicapped people.",3.0

A couple of weeks ago we brought family members to Kennedy School, after telling them all about how wonderful McMenamins was and that they had to experience it for themselves.  One of the things I highlighted is that the service, drink, and food is consistently great.

A week or so later, my boyfriend and I came to this location as a celebration for completing our move that day from Beaverton, OR to Vancouver, WA.  The restaurant was fairly busy but service was fine and the beer was great.  The food however took a very long time and when it came out was not good at all.  My boyfriend and I ordered what we order about 90% of the time (burgers) and were both very disappointed.  I immediately remarked that my burger tasted like a burger from elementary school BBQ day - dry and charcoal-tasting.  My boyfriend showed me that his burger bun was dry and crumbling away, and by the middle of his burger there was hardly any bun left in his hands.  He also commented that his fries were cold, which made me think that our burgers may have been fine initially but left under the food warmer for too long before being brought out.

I am sure we will venture here again as we live so close, but we definitely left this last visit with a bad taste in our mouth about the Vancouver location.  Hopefully what we experienced was a rare occurrence for this location and not the norm.",2.0

3656,3VZR28H98yG79kftnchqqw,"An open letter to Kreuger Farms:

Dear Mr. Kreuger,

I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years.  I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. 

I came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.

I saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, ""that's what supply and demand is."" And walked away.

I would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.

Your ""lesson"" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. 

I know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.

Sincerely,
Former Kreuger farms fan",1.0

Last night was delightful, even if I had to wait 20 minutes for you to warm up two slices of pepp and toss a salad into a to-go box. My fault, I guess, for arriving at 7 p along with every other family in the neighborhood.

I am fully aware and appreciative of the hard work it requires to run a business and be in the service industry, but the experience we had at Trattoria di Monica was truly inexcusable. They made us feel unwelcome and discriminated against as non-white Americans.

My family and I had made in person reservations midday for an 8 pm dinner for a party of 3, where we left our name and contact number. We arrived at the restaurant for our dinner at 7:55 pm - where we were told it would be 15 min before we could be seated. So we ambled around the neighborhood and returned at 7:10, proceeded to wait in front of the restaurant and at 7:15 went in again to ask about our table. We were brusquely told by the hostess it would be another 5 min at least. So we walked down the block and returned again at 7:20 and went in to check on our table again. This time the waitress simply said she had given our table to another party because we had missed our reservation! They had JUST been seated. She was rude and unapologetic, blaming us for not being at the entrance when the table was ready. When asked if they tried calling our number given we had checked in with her 2x, she simply made us feel like we did not understand how things worked. Her demeanor was disrespectful, righteous, and truly disheartening. There was no attempt to accommodate or have us as patrons.",1.0

The food was gross per usual. The potatoes tasted like they were cooked in dirty, rancid oil. Everything else was just bland. AND they gave me gluten-free bread (not all the bread is gluten-free) without warning me that it was gluten-free. I would have brought it up, but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us.

The server was talking to her friend/customer/acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to-go box - which I wanted to take home with me. When confronted, she asked me why I didn't say anything - then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me. Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn't make sense to me. She then offered me potatoes with salsa, when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal.. (I had eaten only a 1/4 of my food.) ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table.

She was nice enough, though her behavior was extremely unprofessional.

3707,ebjSE4FRMoES67x9G2WHKQ,"I caught up with the lovely Erin M here awhile ago for brunch before we did some retail damage. I had never been, but I had heard good things about the jazz brunch and bad things about the waiting times for said jazz brunch. I got there a little early, and was immediately confused about where the front desk was; no one asked if I needed help or directed me to the hostess's desk. After wandering around, I saw someone standing at another desk in a separate room around the corner. I asked how long was a wait for two, and she said maybe 20 minutes. Just then, some space opened up at the bar and we swooshed into the seats. SWOOSH! Win.

The bar is a bit of an awkward shape, narrow in design and cramped, so it's not clear who is standing around waiting for a table and who is actually being served. Our server/bartender was pretty attentive, though clearly busy. She got the point, took our drink orders, gave us the menus, took our food orders, brought our drinks, and then our food showed up. I liked that you could add grits or oatmeal; I love oatmeal with brown sugar, which they keep on the countertop. It was a bit thick and gloppy but tasty enough.

I ordered one of the brunch specials, the eggs benedict, which came with tomato and asparagus and ham and some fruit on the side, and Erin got pancakes. The food was okay; my hollandaise sauce wasn't the best I'd had, and it kind of overwhelmed the dish. The poached eggs were a little overcooked, and I love 'em runny and gooey.

We could hear some jazz in the background, but it didn't contribute much to the ambiance. With the just-fine quality of the food, I would much rather wait 40 minutes for bluegrass brunch at Highland Kitchen.",3.0

CBC sits on the banks of a river in the Brewery District, way off the beaten path compared to most great restaurants in Columbus. Something that makes the experience of CBC a little fun and more like an exploration than just a night out for dinner.

The menu is deep with good items, I fought it out in my mind over 3 different dishes and was quite happy to hear my friends were deciding over the same items. We ended up getting all 3 and all ended up being as good as advertised.

I went with the bourbon buffalo sandwich which was incredible. The garlic fries that come with being somewhat life changingly awesome, were a complete surprise and a total complement to the BBQ goodness of the sandwich.

The atmosphere inside is nice, somewhat modern with touches of wood and holiday decorations that didn't feel cheesy.

Me and my husband have been here several times because we love love love their rotisserie chicken meal. Upon sitting down we looked at the menu but we already knew what we were going to have.

Our server came over and took our order but upon looking around we saw that all the servers including our server, were seated at a long table on the floor eating what I suppose is their lunch. I use to work as a server and it has never been acceptable to eat in front of guest especially if they do not have their food yet. There were about 8 servers seated just eating. We got our food pretty quickly and were very excited to start eating since we love this dish so much. Unfortunately it did not taste as it normally has in the past which is AMAZING! We still ate everything but when our server came around and asked how was everything my husband asked if they had possibly changed the chicken recipe? Because it just didn't taste as it did all the other times we came. She explained that the recipe was still the same so we said ok no big deal. I saw her approach the manager on the floor to tell him about our question on the chicken recipe. He looked at me while she was talking because our server pointed to our table and he rolled his eyes like he did not want to be bothered about the situation. Plus we were the only guest at the restaurant at that time. He not once came to our table. Me and my husband were not looking for a free meal or anything free for that matter because we ate the dish.

So I had to throw in the pickled radish and chicken in the same box. I wonder why I had already tipped 15% for a to go order that I was boxing myself.

3740,CCLnftcuNydCEDO_A-7erA,"They've changed their menu. They've taken A LOT of stuff off, added huge unnecessary pictures to hide the fact that they have about 15 items now,  and increased their prices.

 new patio awesome! some of the decor is kinda strange, but nice improvement.  Unless you are really hot, sit in the lower part when the fans are going because they only have two options, strong or off.  When the fan is on, it cools the pita bread so fast it becomes chips. Which defeats the whole allure of having fresh, soft pita bread.  Which brings me to the most horrible change of them all, the dipping oil up-charge.  

When you first get the bread, everyone goes crazy and can't get enough pita and the dipping oil with the spices! oh man! and for me personally, it was the thing I loved most about coming here.  Now, after you have polished off your first table serving of dipping oil (there were 5 adults so, it went relatively fast), they bring out the next pita and we ask for more dipping oil, it's going to be $1.50! I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, ""so, if you want to pay for it..."" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  

A lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.

They are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere.",2.0

3755,wRBhHMPz1RhCMJv9Gctusg,"I'm happy giving this dealership 1 star, because they fail at everything that a dealership should succeed at AND everything a business should succeed at, period.

For starters, the way I do business, is by referrals. I bought my BMW from Herb Chambers BMW, because my father bought it there; I bought it from the same guy, and I didn't haggle. The truth is I didn't have to haggle, because the guy gave me all the coupons/rebates available, and made the financing process go extremely fast, and painlessly.

After I sold my BMW I was in the market for a more value-priced Honda Accord. I asked for a referral from said gentleman (Kevin Bugby at Herb Chambers BMW). He referred me to a sales person at Herb Chambers Honda that would 'take care of me'. I assumed there would be an equal level of service as what I was accustomed to. Boy was I wrong.

For starters, when I got there (at the scheduled time), he was busy with another customer and handed me off to another sales person. Not a big deal, I know i'm not the only customer out there. I agreed to test drive with this person, after which I asked to speak to my original sales person. I was informed that they were still busy and that this new guy could help me; not a chance, I insisted on waiting, and waited for another good 15 minutes before my original sales person saw me.

I won't delve into the details of the conversation, but after doing substantial research on car prices, I discovered that Herb Chambers Honda was pricing their cars substantially above market value. I pointed this out, and was repeatedly told that this dealership does NOT lower its prices. Fine; but where was the white glove hand holding, where was the loyalty reward for being a Herb Chambers repeat customer. I was treated like a pest off the street. 

In the end I bought a car substantially below Edmunds TMV at a smaller dealership. While that experience also left much to be desired, that dealer worked with me on the price and priced it competitively even though they didn't have to. 

Why 1 star? Because when I buy a car from a dealership, and my father buys a car from that dealership, I expect to be treated better than some guy off the street the third time I go in for a car. No reward for loyalty, no business to you.",1.0

We got there at 2PM on a Friday, so we missed the happy hour (3-6PM).  She got her typical ""beer and a burger"" burger, which happens to include bacon and blue cheese pretty much regardless of the establishment serving it.  I got the Reuben, described on the menu as ""homemade corned beef piled high"" on rye bread with thousand island dressing.  We both opted for the tots as our sides, and I splurged (it was Friday) and also went with a bowl of house-made clam chowder (it is only $1 more than the cup so why not?). Oh, and we each ordered a pint of beer.  I got something red and she got something extra hoppy like an IPA.
 
The beers were outstanding, and the clam chowder was very good as well. Her burger looked very tasty and we both got a good chunk of tater tots.  The Reuben?  Well... I've had a lot of Reubens and this one was pretty... average.  And ""piled high"" really should be taken off the menu's description if what I received represents the standard there.

Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.

Pros
  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with 
    great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken 
    anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as 
    good.
  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste
  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese
  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.

Cons
  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)
  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were 
    there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.

This time, I was in the area, my family had never eaten here, and everyone else has positive things to say about Dixie Crossroads...Well, I am happy to say that it was a much better dining experience.  I had the royal red shrimp this time and it was great.  My husband thought the rock shrimp was just OK.  My son ordered from the kids menu, something he rarely does, but they had more options than just the regular mac-n-cheese/ hamburger found on many kids menus.  He was happy with his flounder.  Hush puppies were devoured.  This place is OK as long as you avoid the salad and the rock shrimp.",3.0
3790,ADR-qTMwaPI8uC1_Bx-ckw,"Sooooo happy we found this place. I have been wanting to go for awhile but Husband (never having had tapas) was resistant (although he loves seafood, rice and ham - go figure!). Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here (""like dim sum honey- only Spanish food...you know, like jamon???!!!""). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable.
Cannot wait to go back!

3791,NXBmSXEzRVrHdbAbUQzMnw,"I went in for an 80 minute prenatal massage.. I had really been looking forward to it because I've had a lot of stressful things going on and just wanted to decompress and get a couple spots worked on that have been bothering me. The front staff was great while I was there. However this is based off of my experience during massage. In my 80 minute massage the massage therapist talked 99% of the time (not even an exaggeration), and even though she worked on my back as requested, she did not work on my specific spots near my shoulder blades that I verbally told her had been bothering me (twice). I've (now) had two masssages ever so this was a big deal to me to spend that much money on one. To be honest when I left I cried in my car because this was not relaxing to me AT ALL when she literally talked just about the entire time. On top of that  my boyfriend had spent $60 on the gift certificate + I paid another $60 after I got there for a service that I wasn't happy with. I'm still having issues with the areas by my shoulder blades and to be honest don't feel any different from prior to having the massage (unlike my first one where I felt a lot of relief / this was done at a different business out of the area with my last pregnancy). I left feeling more stressed out than when I went in for the massage. If I go back, it would not be to this location. I wish I had read the yelp reviews prior to scheduling here. Disappointed is an understatement.",1.0

3793,KP8lXsWOqx_z7zFkoNjNHg,"I should have read the reviews before going here.  A white friend of mine recommended it, he clearly knows nothing about good Dim Sum.

First, place is small and cramp, not enough room to push through a cart.  They hand deliver most of the stuff on a tray.  Interior is out-dated and crampy (80's low ceiling), needs some serious upgraded to the restaurant. 

Except for some of the dumplings, the food was generally cold and not hot like it should be from a steamer.  The fun rolls was very powdery.  They have some pork ribs with some coffee sauce over it.  Sounded interesting so we tried it.  This combo DOES NOT WORK.  I dont know what the chef is thinking.

For my wife and I, a bill of $50.  I dont mind paying for good Dim Sum when food and atmosphere works, this place does not come close.  And your not getting any atmosphere.

I was fooled by the long line into this place.  I can not explain why the wait and long line.  Clearly, white people do not know good Dim Sum.  There was about 20% Asians as well.  I'm guessing they are just trying like me or live near the area and dont want to drive to TNS.

The main course dishes arrived...the special we returned since the pork sausage was undercooked. The other two dishes (Gnochi, and ""Penne ariabata""--made without Penne"") were really not very good. We ate somewhere else on the way home, since we were both still very hungry!

Waited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. Our server was Heidi and she was nice. Not too attentive but very helpful. Ordered red sangria, friend got the sparkling wine flights and they were both OK. The sangria was too sugary.Nothing special which is crazy since they make their own wine and that's their thing. Maybe I'm just use to the bottle wines I like, who knows. Appetizer was Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They delicious. The amount of chicken was not enough for three people but it came with onion crunches, chopped cabbage mix and delicious cucumbers. For dinner I ordered the flatbread and salad combination, Carne Asada flatbread and Caesar pesto salad. The salad was really really good. I didn't really taste much pesto but it was faintly in the background which added so much flavor. The flatbread was perfect. The bottom was crunchy and the meat was very tender.

3812,8QpXLJjFAUhSEcEOALmKiw,"Popped in on a cold, cold night. As a Texan out of her element, pizza was a warm comfort food I was more than willing to partake in. It's kind of a hole in the wall on Pearl Street that sells pizza by the slice or as a whole pie. The crust was satisfyingly doughy and the red sauce is tangy and warm. Perfect for the biting weather. The dude behind the counter gave a strange answer when asked what his favorite was: cheese pizza with hot sauce. Really? I'm not going to order cheese pizza with hot sauce lol. 

Our friend took him up on it, though. The cheese pizza was good. It had that melted cheese pizza smell that would make the ninja turtles crap their pants, if they wore any. The ""hot sauce"" was a warmed cup of buffalo sauce. Gross! We got the supreme pizza and a Hawaiian pizza. The supreme pizza was loaded with bell peppers and olives.

3813,l_c4Lgbcfw3by4rdFKb1Fg,"Okiedokie, let's do a little education first.  When a restaurant is small and extremely popular and in a very popular part of town, you make a reservation, m'kay?  Being told you have to wait or there isn't a table when you walk up during dinner or brunch rush is not the restaurant's fault, it is yours.  We decided on a whim to come here, but called ahead and made a reservation for later that evening.  Yes, we had to wait 2 hours for that reservation, but because we called we were able to go shopping and do other things rather than sit and stare sourly at the host.

Also, I found the staff to be superbly pleasant and obviously dedicated to their work.  I watched the entire staff while there, as I had a view of the entire room, and it was like a dance.  They all help each other and watch out for each other and give a head's up or quick word to the table's waiter if it wasn't their table.  The manager walked the room three times while I was there and spoke to each guest at least once to ensure a pleasurable experience.  This was a level of service and cooperation rarely seen outside the five-star scene.
If you find attitude here, you brought it yourself, love.

The food is carefully crafted to bring out specific flavors and combinations that the chef has designed.  This is not Applebees.  This is carefully crafted food, and it may not all be to your taste.  But that is the theme and design of this restaurant.  Frankly, I f***ing love it.  No, not everything on the menu, but the concept.  I spoke with the staff throughout the meal, and they take care to buy local when possible and also sustainably raised/harvest food when possible.  I like that in a restaurant, as that is how I eat at home.

The drinks were also crafted with as much care as the food.  And while pricey, it was worth every penny.  Don't come here on a budget, but it's not overly expensive either.  The value matches the pricing perfectly.",5.0

The tentacles were very hard almost crunchy and the rings were beyond chewy. This dish was clearly cooked wrong and long.

People were wandering around with wet hair and I realized Cuts for the Cause is all about volume (unintended hair pun). They just wash and cut, there is no blow dry/styling. 

After about 45 minutes, I was hooked up with a stylist who works at the salon. As for the cut, well, it's not the best cut I've had but it's not the worst. The person who cut my hair was nice enough and seemed competent but there was no chance for her to check the cut after it was dry and tweak as necessary.

Second course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. 

Third course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme brûlée, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! 

This place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!

This place used to be 4 star at least. Now I really want to give it a 1. 

First of all, the hostess sat me, a disabled lady with a cane, as far away from the door as possible without being the back of the restaurant. I had to navigate a through a crowded restaurant. Even on good days, I'm wobbly. 

Then we found out that they no longer have any gluten-free items marked on the menu, and I was flipping through not seeing anything I could eat (I am gluten-intolerant, and can get really sick from eating it). And, I was irritated but telling myself well at least I can have the creme brulee that was honestly my reason for choosing HP for dinner. Then I see the dessert section.  No creme brulee. *head desk*

I ended up getting a side of cheese grits because it was the only thing I could safely eat besides maybe a $9 salad. $9 for a salad? No. I can't justify that as ""affordable"". 

I'm not going to bother going back unless I hear that they've done something good with the menu.",2.0

(OK, to tell you the truth it seemed like a hassle to be sent sample frames, send them back etc.) But while on vacation in Austin 2 weeks ago, I noticed this huge Warby Parker store downtown and figured it couldn't hurt to see if I could at least pick out frames there and then order online. Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all! I picked out beautiful trendy frames and a salesperson measured my face in about 5 seconds using this thing that looks like a simple cardboard box. When I told her that my prescription was pretty strong (around a -5.5), they said no problem. They took my optometrist's phone number, swiped my card, got my email address and -POOF- the next day I got an email saying they'd gotten my prescription from the optometrist. One week later, my gorgeous new glasses came in the mail! Please understand that I know what good glasses are and how they should fit. I've been in glasses forever and have bought just about every designer at one point or another. And these really are GREAT glasses. I was skeptical at best, I mean I'm used to spending 400-500 bucks on new glasses, and these were only 125. But they are made beautifully. And they fit PERFECTLY, and they don't even fog in the cold.

He basically apologized for our presence, and she still couldn't muster up a fake pleasant attitude. 
As we had never been, we wanted to try some flavors, but she was so visibly annoyed, that we both just picked flavors to buy and left. Which was a bummer when we were looking forward to trying some of the fun flavors. My boyfriend then tipped her a wad of dollar bills and still nothing.

The clientele has gone from cool hipster/hippie/tattooed musician types to a$$hole suburbanites/west Austinites who know NOTHING about normal dog behavior and starting arguments/fights.  I saw a guy with his female companion bring the dog they LITERALLY just rescued from TLAC there.  the dog had that blue and white temporary leash on and was behaving very puppy-like, which means my dogs thought it was party time.  The guy had no clue about normal dog play (they were playing chase--no teeth showing/growling/etc.), and started a fight with me and my husband, saying we're the type of people who ruin the park for everyone (?!?!).  Ugh.

The parking situation is beyond horrendous now.  The cops ticket everybody who isn't parking in an assigned space.  They ticket people parked on Red Bud Lane.  They just plain ticket everyone.  And good luck finding a space--there are literally about 10-12 spaces and you circle around for 20+ minutes waiting for someone to leave.  And good luck trying to actually get it without getting cut off by some out-of-stater stealing it from you.

The Service: Took our order, never asked if we'd been there before so when it came time to pay we weren't sure if she took our money or if we were supposed to pay at the hostess area. Never came back and asked if we wanted a warm-up on our coffee or if we needed anything else. Brought the bill out at the same time she brought the food- never a good look. She did bring us an accurate order in a timely fashion. However, had she paid a bit more attention to us, she would have received a much better tip. We tend to tip 50% for great service. Also, we were going to grab some muffins to go but never had the chance to order or ask the server's opinions so ultimately, this place lost out on some money because of the service as well. 

The Food: We tried French toast, eggs, Belgium waffle and bacon. Bacon and ""eggs"" (beaters) were incredibly greasy. My mouth is coated in oil. Waffle was cold and the French toast did taste good. 

The Value: This is where they lose us as customers- the prices are insane. Almost $9 for a waffle? Almost $9 for 4 pieces of French toast? Bacon was precooked Oscar Meyer, and eggs were not real eggs. If an establishment is going to charge that much for a simple breakfast- that breakfast better be incredible.

First of all, the romaine lettuce was so pale, I wasn't even sure it was romaine from a glance. But even worse.... the chicken breast.... the basil grilled chicken breast... was served sliced on the salad WITH THE SKIN. 
Gooey, stringy, slimy chicken skin.

The food itself is pretty good.  I will say the little matzoh ball was the right consistency and had nice flavor (you get two with the bowl) and the meat knish had a great crust and filling.

There may be less expensive options, but Paul's is close to my office, he and his staff have been extremely helpful and nice to me, they have gone out of their way to help me numerous times, and I trust them with my car completely.

3882,mIwyEu4SNnywGCHB6-qR8A,"Amazingly unique science-fiction and fantasy haven.

LIKES: I googled unique restaurants in Vancouver and that is how I found this place. I can't say I've ever eaten anywhere like it. The walls are covered with memorabilia, original movie posters and statues from science-fiction and fantasy books and movies throughout the years. Our waitress told us that Elijah Wood just ate there recently because he wanted to see all the Lord of the rings memorabilia. Anyway, it was a fun experience and our waitress was great. My favorite part was just walking around; taking in the scenery. They had a fun game where you can roll a 20 sided dice and that would determine what kind of shot you drink. Unique. 

DISLIKES: The food was just mediocre. If this place is visited mostly by single adult male basement-dwellers then they will feel right at home with the carb-heavy gaming food. I wasn't a big fan of it but would come back again just for the atmosphere",3.0

I would however have to say that of all the locations here in Vancouver, this one is by far the worst (oh wait just saw a review for Metrotown Winners...perhaps I stand corrected). Either way, this location is surely no prize. Unfortunately this location is a block from my office so I rolled in last week with one thing on the brain 'Travel Coffee Mug', which I found about a half hour later after a few failed attempts. I was just disgusted by the state of the store. I mean I get that the traffic there must be ridiculous but the place was honestly in shambles, if you're getting the traffic, then you're getting the sales and should be able to employ enough people to keep your store from looking like a flop house. I dodged the crowds and headed to the teeny tiny home section at the back of the store and tried not to touch anything. Seriously I'm in no way a germophobe but this place was just a mess. I thought I might find something on the clearance rack but that just seemed to be a haven for broken merchandise. I didn't actually find anything I liked in the home section and dejectedly was making my way to the front to escape when low and behold I found my current travel mug on a display by the cash.

3896,OBjUlvu5aoApvIjrFnl_jA,"I was so apprehensive about going to this place. I LOVED the Avalon... although when I used to go there for shows, I was too young to drink and thus could not be discouraged by expensive drink prices, and during most of the time I spent on Lansdowne I was attending gay night at either Avalon, Axis or Embassy (mostly Embassy). Now that the mainstream gay scene in Boston is mostly defunct, I was anxious to see what kind of monster replaced my beloved crappy-ass clubs.

My first thought was... holy security. They have at LEAST 15 dudes who get paid to stand down the street and point people toward the door. The entrance procedure is pretty... stupid. I don't see why you have a line of people using metal detecting wands, and no one scanning tickets. The scanners are right outside the door of the ballroom, and if you want to leave the ballroom and go out into the hallway, where the snacks are, two security people have to chase you down and put an X on your hand to grant you re-entry. You should have absolutely free reign to go between the hallway and the ballroom.

The coat check is FIVE DOLLARS (groan). I don't even think they charge five dollars for the coat check at expensive clubs like Rumor. I left really early so I had no problem getting my coat, but I'm sure it's a nightmare if you stay until the end of the show.

Also, if you're a smoker, prepare for hours upon hours without a cigarette. It made me fondly miss the strange fenced-in areas on the side of Avalon & Axis where you could smoke without technically leaving the building, and the smoker's balcony at Embassy. 

The decor is strange, to say the least. I guess it's supposed to celebrate ""Unity in Diversity,"" but really, I don't understand what Buddhism has to do with Tom Jones or Lady GaGa. Drinks are kind of expensive, but what do you expect from a franchise venue like that? The second floor balcony is where you wanna be, in my opinion. It almost matches the Roxy balconies in viewing awesomeness. And, I have to say, the sound really is phenomenal in there. I will go again, I'm already planning on seeing The Faint/Ladytron in April, but I'm only going for bands I really love. Otherwise, it's just so expensive and really not worth it.

3897,8no-zEXFEls7llfQsMtPLw,"Tales of August 2008 Restaurant Week: 
First Stop: Olive's!!!

With anticipation of greatness, I booked my Restaurant Week reservation for Olive's way in advance because it's impossible to get in here otherwise.  And now, I understand why!

I love the atmosphere!  The upscale, Soho-feel interior of Olives blends well with the charm of trendy brick elegance of City Sq.  I loved being able to glance outside and see the Bunker Hill monument.  The tables were all quite close together, which did make it a bit noisy and less private.  I personally feel that the bar area would've been better dedicated to more seating but then again I didn't have to wait for a table.

Then the food and service: Mm-mm good all around!  Thank you attentive staff for clearing my dishes promptly and taking the time to sweep away the table crumbs just in time for the next dish to arrive! These folks get five stars by themselves! 
Honestly all the food looked great, but I highly recommend the flounder dish to anyone...the combination with the lobster macaroni and spinach is just awesome.  I was pretty full by the time it got around to dessert but the strawberry rhubarb did not disappoint!  I suspect that the tasty bread and olives (the place lives up to its name) and appetizer are to blame for my later lack of appetite...just a thought.

Olives was definitely well worth booking in advance! I would go back on a regular night for a special occasion, but need to deduct a star for the interior noise.",4.0

The molcajetes were both missing the ""zesty avocado salsa"". The flank steak was very tough and the molcajete (yes, it's literally served in a molcajete) is about 8"" high and bowl-shaped. It was challenging to cut through the meat, what with the butter knives we had. 

Three of our party ordered fajitas, and, again they were missing the guac and also the salsa they were supposed to come with. They were also just round iron skillets with onions, peppers and the meat. I'm not sure if they're trying to make a minimalist statement by withholding beans, rice, cheese, pico de gallo, etc, but what the hay? Fajitas are kind of a diy meal. You get a bunch of stuff and you mix it up the way you like, right?

One of the fajita-orderers asked for salsa and it was crazy hot. I realize that heat is a subjective thing. Suffice it to say that my tongue can take some heat but this was habanero'ed. I could eat it but it was painful. I'm not saying I didn't eat it. I did. I can't NOT eat salsa if it's in front of my face. But I would have preferred more flavor, less heat.

I got there earlier than my brother and sister-in-law and decided to try a mix drink since the other yelpers had mixed experiences about them. I spent that $10 for you, readers. And didn't finish my watery dark and stormy (was there actually alcohol in it? I couldn't really tell). I was seated at a corner table downstairs, underneath an overhang. My brother only bumped his head on the ceiling once or twice, and the protruding corner after one beer. The beer list was decent (saving grace?).

We split the fries with truffle oil for the appetizer, I had the tuna salad, sister-in-law had another salad, and Bro had the much hyped lobster mac n'cheese. Hm. 

The fries were hot, that's always nice. I could *kind of* taste the truffle oil, I guess it was a nice little addition to the fairly run-of-the mill fries, but that's pretty much all I can say about it. This might be a nice thing to get if you're just there for a drink or two (get beer or wine for yourself, seriously, avoid the mix drinks) and want something greasy to go along with it. 

The salads were decent but overdressed--the lettuce on mine was good lettuce but I couldn't taste it because of all of the oil! The tuna was done really well, though, by really well I mean almost completely rare, which is how I roll with tuna steak. Maybe a straight up tuna steak would be good at this place, I'll never know. 

Ok, on to the Mac N'Cheese. Seriously guys? All those people who raved about this stuff--do you really like the cheese to pool at the bottom of the bowl rather than being thick enough to be included in each bite of the food?? The taste was decent (I mean, cheesy lobster is really tough to eff up) but I thought the consistency was pretty nasty. The thin creamy cheese didn't make sense in a signature dish, and my brother started to wonder if he even likes mac n'cheese at all after how bummed he was about his meal. Trust me Bro, let's go to Zaftigs and get some real mac n'cheese before you make up your mind on that one.

Atmosphere: 5 stars - Beautiful view, clean bathrooms, great decor, nice art and hip vibe. Night time I'm sure is really nice.

Service: 5 stars - Friendly, attentive

Food: 3 stars

Ahi Tuna Taco - Their most popular dish supposedly. Tuna may be frozen but still good. Wonton shell and spicy mayo/avocado with a little lime was a nice combo. Just NO SEASONING and lacked flavor. I was dying just for a little touch of ponzu or something just to bring everything together.

Native Lobster roll - Great lobster with generous portions. Brioche roll was nice. Again, a lack of SEASONING and just a bit bland

Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich- Nice quality prime rib shavings. Horseradish sauce is more creamy and very mild. Its juicy so it soaks up in the bread. Again, a bit bland like everything else. I noticed their picture puts gravy on the side but I think mine was pour over the sandwich. 

Fritas- Though I complain that everything was under salted and I thought this was OVER salted than most fries. Otherwise, a good lunch frita. Individual ketchup, pretty cool

Verdict 2 stars: I wouldn't be so picky if the prices weren't SO HIGH. Maybe the public has a blander palate but I think this is basic execution to properly season dishes. After tax, this total was $55 for two sandwiches and an appetizer for lunch.",3.0

3948,iNEHsFOoeJeSvFYWUGgbrg,"Update 8/29/2014: The recent strike ordeal revealed that Market Basket is an exceptionally good organization.  When the TV movie is made telling the story of Arthur T., I want to have a cameo as a customer.  :)

Update 12/21/2013: Market Basket does not earn 100% marks because their new plastic carry bags are tissue paper thin although they look the same as the old ones.  When single-bagged, these new shopping bags are so thin, a soft styrofoam meat package can rub through it.  They cannot withstand pressure or rubbing.

Market Basket has no web site, no receipt survey, and does not actively seek customer feedback.  If Yancy-F-127 haphazardly crushes your eggs and makes a messy soup in the bottom of your shopping bag each time, while Aurelia-G-186 treats your eggs as carefully as if they are her own, the managers are not aware of who are their best, and who are their worst, cashiers.  The management is not in the loop to resolve ongoing problems quickly. 

Original:

This is the Boston metro area's last best chance for a ""everyday-low-price"" style supermarket.  Market Basket is super busy on the weekends and specially the night before a holiday weekend.  It is not the place you should expect the cashiers to ever know you by name.  It is busy.  It is high volume.

For people lacking time to shop weekly fliers for bargains, Market Basket will be easiest on your wallet when buying most assorted foods.  It is a place to find 25 pound bags of jasmine Asian rice.  The regular price of fresh produce will often beat the sales price of other grocery stores.  Frequent bargain announcements blasted over the store PA system gives the place some personality.

Shoppers who hate long lines may want to shop elsewhere regardless of higher costs.  However, if you visit Market Basket during bad weather in the middle of the week, long lines can be avoided.",5.0

but he said I should be open minded and give it a try.  So off we went.

Little Beast is located in an old house on Division street, which is a nice street to walk, filled with restaurants and bars.  I started with a beer sampler that the waiter recommended and I have to say, for 
someone who doesn't drink much beer, I really enjoyed it.  My friend told me that some of the best brew in town can be had at Little Beast.  The menu had some truly original items including steak tartar, and 
a shrimp roll that was filled with fresh shrimp.  Mmmm, I really liked that shrimp roll.  I didn't try the steak tartar but my friend said it was excellent.

3955,6aVIn5YN3QMKKz89a528lg,"Hearth Pizza Tavern is in a strip mall with a Whole Foods, Dollar Tree, Psycho Sisters Consignment Shop, and oft-touted Canton Cooks, right off of busy Roswell Road. Hearth aims to please all of the customers of this OTP-but-only-by-a-hundred-yards Sandy Springs neighborhood. 

They serve all of the usuals you'd expect from a pizza joint - or a tavern: calamari, Parmesan french fries, salads, sammies, and personal or sharable pizzas. They also entice the ""Whole Foods crowd"" with ingredients like goat cheese, eggplant chips, sundried tomatoes, truffle aioli, and caramelized onions. Some of these are hits (caramelized onions on flat bread, goat cheese on salads) and some are misses (who tastes the truffle in the aioli served with the fries? why pretend to eat vegetables and order the eggplant 'chips'? calamari....again?) 

There are quite a few pleasant surprises: 
-The Chili Oil that comes with the Flatbread appetizer and on the Ring of Fire pizza - spicy, deliciousness 

-Baby Arugula Salad - the lemon-basil vinaigrette is fantastic, the greens are fresh, and the toppings are well-balanced 

-The White Pizza - while nothing new, it is executed with delicious cheese, and a lovely charred, yet chewy crust 

-The best surprise: the bar. They have a full liquor selection, lots of wine, and an impressive collection of craft beers. In my opinion, beer pairings can make or break a meal and all three times I've been to Hearth, the bartender and serves were very knowledgeable about their modest, but deep beer selection.

I don't remember what they said was in it aside from vodka, but it was very refreshing and goes down smooth on a hot summer day like yesterday. I thought it had a little too much ice though, it easily took up at least half the glass. I can't really complain though for $3.

Service was decent and they have a good amount of patio seating. The back patio is pretty nice since you can enjoy the fresh air and still be covered from direct sunlight.

Topline: Incredible food, pleasant atmosphere, a bit pricey.

Went in a group of six, which was genius because we got to try a variety of items.  The bread and hummus/dip that comes out to start off is very good and tasty... but don't overdo it because the food gets better as you go on.

For apps we had the bruschetta which came with chunks of chicken and was good (but I'm not huge on bruschetta so can't comment farther).  The calamari was fanstastic - well cooked, in a slightly spicy red sauce and the portion size was large and came with two big crostinis too.  I love that it was NOT fried like it is everywhere else you go.  We also go the eggplant/spinach/ricotta app and I'm pretty sure we licked that bowl clean - even the people who did not like veggies were in love with it.  I would consider it as an entree with a side of pasta in the future.

I had the whole wheat linguine with squash, peas, tomatoes, mozzarella and some other veggies.  Good, light sauce and healthy but flavorful feel overall.

One friend had the gemelli with shrimp and scallops which actually sounded like the best thing on the menu but was slightly disappointing to me. The sauce was a brandy-gorgonzola, which was GOOD and quite unique but a little watery for the dish.  I would have liked them to thicken it up a bit.

Two friends got the chef's special risotto for the night and everyone was SUPER impressed with it.  Good portion size, perfect al dente, incredible flavor and lots of beautiful ingredients.  Excellent choices.

Another friend got the penne with chicken, sundried tomatoes, olives, and I forget what else.  This sounded plain on the menu but was actually quite good. I think it was my favorite thing on the table!

The manfriend's dad is in the wine business and wanted to treat us with some awesome food so we were to meet him and his wife for a 7pm reservation. We were there at 6:30, and needless to say: it was PACKED. A lovely bartender saw us trying to avoid traffic and immediately asked if she could get us anything. Two glasses of pinot noir coming right up! The bartenders did an amazing job keeping track of the order people came in so they could point them to seats as soon as one cleared up.

Manfriend's Poppa and Momma bear came promptly at 6:45 to check in, only to find the reservation was at 7:30 pm. Momma bear promptly pulled up a voicemail they'd left with her earlier in the morning to show us they'd reminded her it was 7. We were all excited though and continued to dodge the waitstaff as we waited for our new reservation.

Once finally seated, we ordered the brie and calamari for the table. The brie was a much smaller portion than I expected and buried underneath a mountain of arugula. It was a nice attempt, but all the toppings and dressings washed out the brie. The calamari was delicious--perfectly crisped and battered. The bread of course was to die for. The manager even came by with a plate of bolognese to apologize for the mess up. This was AMAZING!

After a bit of a wait (expected since it was crowded), our food came...and it just went downhill. Manfriend's sauce that the salmon sat in tasted like salsa. My medium-rare burger was actually well done. Momma bear's porkchop had a different side from the one she requested and was completely dried out. Poppa bear was also missing a side. We didn't bother waiting for corrections--we'd already been there for 2.5 hours just waiting from start till now. My burger probably would've been good, but I left half of it untouched. A well done burger just isn't a burger anymore. I ordered a drink instead....which also never came.

I was so horribly disappointed by the end of the meal. It's hard to stay mad at the staff since they're actually VERY sweet, but they just didn't handle our dinner service well at all.",2.0

Seating is limited to just counter space and a couple of small tables outside, with parking just as cramped. There is a takeout window on the side, which I typically order from and just eat in my car or sitting on the curb. Hotdogs are extremely inexpensive (~$2 with toppings), boil cooked, and tasty. There is no bend or squish to them, just a nice hard snap. Buns are just the way I like them, soft and moist. Toppings (ketchup, relish, etc) seem out of a can, but still quality goods. Orders usually take no more then a minute or two, and the staff is friendly as you'll find.

They aren't the best dogs I've had before, but certainly some of the better, and for the price, you really can't beat them. I believe they do serve some other items, but all I've ever had are the dogs, and never had a complaint. Certainly recommend if you're in the area or just have a craving.",4.0

The layout isn't like most other falafel/kabob shops I've been to. You order from the menu at the register but you don't get to customize what goes on your sandwich/wrap. I was kind of annoyed by this since what I was served, lacked all of the great condiments that I've come to love on my falafel. The falafel wrap was very tasty though I have to admit. It wasn't the flavor combo I had been craving but still tasty.

The price of my falafel wrap was much better compared to my husband's lamb plate. For $13.95 he got a heap of rice and 2 little chunks of lamb. Again, he said it was delicious but very overpriced for the portion.

4033,5EC74cLqH_2hVYUuW83xUg,"The Buckle is what every clothing retail store should model themselves after. They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other ""teenager/young adult premium wear"" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.

The quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. 

Although their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.

As far as customer service/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.

We quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!

I also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between ""rise"", ""fit"", ""leg opening"", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.

Overall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.",5.0

4041,LIhj1O4bsdrKHxykhsLRNw,"I went out for brunch by myself after working OT at my job. It's very chic and modern and I would have easily mistaken it as a very expensive restaurant. It's not that expensive. I was glad they didn't mind my casual look and I was able to sit down in the cocktail lounge area which had a view of 6th Street. 

I was bummed they didn't have the Acai Berry smoothie and I wasn't in the mood for coffee because the last thing I needed was more coffee in my system. I ordered for appetizer the Fried Point Judith Calamari which basically I'm a sucker for Fried Calamari. It's one of those items where if a restaurant, I'll order it without hesitation. Then I had the Kobe Burger w/ cheddar, avocado and bacon. It was stacked very high and it was guaranteed to fall apart when I take the first bite. The food and the service was good.",4.0

We have only had take out but my daughter says everyone has been nice to her each time she has gone. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because it has to be the best food ever for me to give it more than 3 stars.,3.0

The flatbread sandwich was sub-par due to the fact that the pork was dry and bland while the bread was tasteless.
The noodles were good, but I did not get as much flavor as expected from the dish. Having tasted other Chinese places in Chinatown, I cannot get myself to give this place more than 2 stars.

We were seated and waited for quite a long time to put our order in, which would be fine, the company was good and we were visiting.  The problem occurred after we had been sitting for 1 hour and 20 minutes and still had no food in front of us.  Luckily we did not have small children with us.  

It was 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time we sat down until our food arrived.  In that time we had to ask for water and coffee every time, our server came by voluntarily one time and when I asked for some bread for our son we were brought biscuits that were ""on the house"". I understand that it was a special occasion, but the restaurant was only half full and of those tables I would guess that most had reservations, so they knew what they were getting in to for the day.

When our food finally did arrive half of it came  a full 5 minutes after the first half.  The one order of steak and egg was both cold and missing the egg.  We sent it back, after 5 minutes it returned not re-fired but simply re-heated with an egg thrown on top, so that the steak was then over cooked.

4085,x7Dg4omLgl1tEY1s-xddTw,"I should probably qualify this review up front by admitting that every time I have eaten at Artist Point I was on the Disney Dining Plan. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the DDP it is a prepaid dining package that you can purchase if you are staying in a Walt Disney World resort. Essentially you pay for your meals in advance and if you are a crafty diner -like me- you can really get a lot of bang for your buck and end up saving some money in the long run. So take my review with a grain of salt because I went BIG at Artist Point and did so without regret. 

Of all the WDW eateries Artist Point is firmly entrenched in my top three. Artist Point gets huge bonus points for featuring an extensive wine selection from the under appreciated Pacific Northwest. I'm a pushover when it comes to a good wine pairing and always ask my server to match a glass to each course. Since they are trained in this and I am not I leave it to the professionals. 

I am a big fan of the artisan cheese course and like a typical American I treat this as an appetizer instead of an end of the meal treat. The trio of cheeses covers a safe yet broad selection of fromage including a nice cheddar, a creamy goat and a tangy blue. This was matched nicely with an Oregon Pinot Noir. 

There are two dishes Artist Point is famous for; the cedar plank salmon and the buffalo. Choosing between these two wonderful dishes is almost a Sophie's Choice caliber decision. Of course if you know that Artist Point has an off the menu surf and turf option where you can have both you won't have to decide. It's kind of like getting your burger ""animal style"" at In-N-Out because unless you know to ask for it you wouldn't know it is there. Both dishes are wonderful and served in smaller portions when combined so you can enjoy both without being wasteful. 

Desserts leave a little to be desired at Artist Point. The signature berry cobbler just doesn't do it for me. The chocolate cheesecake and the clafouti (a rustic baked custard pie with fruit) are better choices.

Artist Point is a popular restaurant so make sure yu contact Disney Dining for a priority seating time.",5.0

In a hurry to catch a delayed plane and needing a quick caffeine fix!
Thought I could satisfy the urge here but it was a cumbersome process. The cashier was S-L-O-W! Finally at the head of the line and I order a Green Tea Latte-cold!  Watch in awe as the Indonesian barista fouls up every order. The lady in front of me wanted a NON-FAT drink and reacts in horror as this barista uses full fat milk to pour!

4087,H4_fz0ngJzBqNTjJdJed-w,"Based on the positive reviews I read for this food trailer, I bought a Groupon and I was not disappointed in the food. I had the Red Curry, Spring Rolls & Egg Rolls. My wife and I enjoyed them thoroughly.

What I did not like about the experience, was the lack of flexibility on the part of the counter staff. 

My wife and I are from Canada, we like to experiment with new restaurant experiences by using Groupons. Because we are from Canada, it costs us a small fortune for roaming data services on our cell phone. We buy our groupons, and save an image of the groupon, including the SKU/Bar Code so it can be documented by the restaurant. We have presented the image to dozens of different restaurants and the staff simply wrote down the Groupon Coupon # and proceeded with the transaction .. but NOT Trai Mai Thai .. the staff refused to allow me to use my groupon unless they could touch the screen on my smartphone to mark the coupon as ""Redeemed"", I explained other restaurants do not have a problem simply taking the number .. but they refused to do so. As a result, I had to delete the Groupon APP from my wife's phone (she has a limited data plan), reload the APP, sign in using my account (Groupon APP does not allow multiple accts), bring up the coupon so the counter staff could touch the ""Redeem"" Icon, then delete the APP, reload the APP and restore my wife's Groupon Acct. Had I known this restaurant did not have the flexibility to deal with a Groupon by writing down the Coupon #, I would have never purchased the Groupon or visited this restaurant. But, the food was great ... creates quite a dilemma, great food .. but lousy customer service!

I would rate the food as 5 Star, but given the customer service and lack of flexibility in accepting a Groupon, even though I explained our unique cell phone/data issues .. the staff could not have cared less, so overall a 3 Star is suitable.

More good news though, management quickly responded, confirmed that staff should have simply wrote down the Groupon # and new staff have been brought up to date on the procedure.",3.0

4093,232lfeR3QJx02FjIghwi2g,"On a lark (which is a bird according to wikipedia and doesn't really make a whole lot of sense used in the phrase 'on a lark') we decided to try something different for dinner and went to Cafe Josie.  This was  an excellent decision (and no larks were harmed in the process).

The restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.

We had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.

For dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.

I know, I know, Vancouver. It's touristy, I'm touristy and altogether we're this sloppy, touristy sandwich posing around Gastown. I am sorry for that and I understand your disdain: I live in LA and we get that touristy crapola all the time.

But,but...hear me out. Chill Winston wasn't that bad, in fact I didn't think it was touristy at all. Shout out goes to the cute Hostess rocking a shaved head and the curvy girl indulging cheap fashion spots around Vancouver; you made an LA girl feel at home.

Look, the poutine was crazy good, all gooey and savory with a hint of Jack Daniels. The beer list, heavy with microbrews, were fantastic and Winston's Earl Grey Creme Brulee'? Say whattttt? My dining companions had the blueberry coffee cake which disappeared after a 5 minute trek to the bathroom. 

Stop that, Winston. Delivering good food on a warm summer day. 

Shame on you. 

Look, I know it may seem pretentious, but that vibe wasn't there at all. Our servers were on the ball, a mix of white apron crisp and urban cool, and no one caused any dramatic, touristy scenes. So, locals...give this place a chance...it's honestly a pretty cool spot to nosh.",4.0
4096,V5z3SiDkywSmynX8Xi_3hQ,"Like everyone else, I went to The Eye Studio because of all of the wonderful Yelp reviews.  Plus, it was close to work, and I'm a sucker for convenience.

I went to Dr. Tsai for about 18 months for a dry eye situation that I notice the most when I wake up around 3 a.m.  She had me wear my contacts less and less, go on steroid drops, Omega 3 pills, twice daily eyelid washes, warm eye compresses and what I felt were rather regular appointments.  None of it helped.  I still wake up in the middle of the night with eyes that feel like sandpaper.  

It was the same every appointment.  I'd explain what I was experiencing to Dr. Tsai.  She'd tell me that my dry eyes were related to wearing contacts.  I'd share the fact that I first noticed the dry eye problem when I wore contacts once or twice a year - usually for weddings.  She'd recommend that I wear my contacts less.

This happened three or four times until I realized that Dr. Tsai wasn't actually listening to me.  She had committed to a specific course of treatment, and there was nothing I could say to change it.

Two weeks later I went in for my annual eye exam.

After the exam, Dr. Tsai launched into a lecture all about the long-term ramifications of dry eye, and how I needed to address my condition - soon.  I had to stop her midsentence and ask if the issue was really that much worse than two weeks earlier when she told me that it was manageable.  That's when I realized something.

She hadn't bothered to read my patient file before the exam. 

I get it.  She sees lots of other patients.  I could have been any one of the hundreds, which is why I have a patient file that holds the details specific to me and my desert like eyes.

To add insult to injury, I continued to work with Dr. Tsai and her staff while trying to find a new contact lense brand.  On the surface they give the impression that they want to help, but it resulted in a snarky e-mail from a patient care coordinator and the longest two months of my life.  

That's right - option one was a bust and not even the brand I had requested.  It took them over a week to even order option two.  Then Dr. Tsai tried to feed me a line about how it could take my eyes over two weeks to adjust to a new prescription. 

It turned out that I didn't need to work through the headaches while my eyes adjusted.  The contacts had been ordered with the wrong prescription - specifically the wrong axis.  

Dr. Tsai gave me a song and dance about how each contact brand is different from the last.  She told me not to worry. We'd keep at it until we found the right pair.

By my next appointment, she had ordered the right axis for option two and ordered a third brand.  Neither of which worked for me.  Then she told me that we could continue to work on this, but I'd need to pay another contact fitting fee of close to $100.

Yes, I'm demanding.  If I'm wearing corrective lenses, I'd like to see clearly.  Yes, she ordered four pairs of contacts for me - three different brands.  I had specifically asked for one brand, but it wasn't ordered until option two.  At that point, someone ordered the wrong prescription.  

I will only take responsibility for two pairs of contacts.  The other two are squarely on Dr. Tsai and her staff.
 
After all of this, I still don't have a current contact prescription.  And, I'm officially done with The Eye Studio.",2.0

I just used my Groupon.  Though the food was good, the lacklustre service from the man was not worth the visit.  We got there about 1:50 PM and ordered two savoury crepes and a soup of the day and a coffee.  We did not get our crepes until 2:46 PM, nearly one hour later.  During that time, we waited patiently half an hour, and when they didn't bring our crepes, we asked them when it would be ready.  They told us we were next, but for the next twenty minutes, the guy continued bringing food to other customers who arrived after us.  I complained to the server/cashier, and he just shrugged and said they couldn't do anything as there were others he was serving.

It tasted almost bitter....But it was a Friday, and much needed, so I sucked it down anyways.  The burgers looked much better than they tasted.  Both came out looking like an in-n-out burger, which got me really excited. The excitement soon faded after my first bite. The burger was not seasoned at all and the bread did not taste fresh.  The fries weren't much better-they were limp as if they weren't cooked long enough. Service wise the guy was super nice who took our order.

Lunch is a great time to go as far as their lunch specials.  You can order 2 sushi rolls from a good selection for $8.95, and for 3 rolls I believe it's under $12.

Their service is something that this restaurant can do so much better.  There's typically only one server up front, and depending how busy it is - you could be waiting a while to get your food and check.

However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  

I ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.

It was SO delicious! 3 out of the 4 of us had the black linguine as our entree. I had such high hopes for it! But it was just okay. I felt like the pasta water more than likely wasn't salted.

4107,jWGhpdmVxfI5keZykgJu0A,"This place serves a really mediocre dinner.

Fish and chips were actually quite tasty, not too much batter, two large pieces for $15.

The steak frites though was terrible ($18). I asked for no frites and extra salad. The salad it came with had a really yummy dressing, but it was -drowning- in dressing, an inch at the bottom of the bowl excess. Instead of extra salad, they added some baby greens and blueberries to the board (see photo uploaded). It wasn't dressed at all, and there were only like 5 blueberries but they were in really rough shape - why not just leave them out instead of serve subpar food?

It was also a poor cut of steak, and although cooked well (medium rare), it was super chewy, cold by the time it got to the table, and too salty.

I'd give a 4/5 for the fish and chips, a 1/5 for the steak frites, like seriously just don't order it. And a 4/5 for the ambience, it's brand new inside and cute decor.

4108,j3xpC1t-hbUfJiTYYn3eqQ,"South Congress Cafe continues to impress me every single time I visit, which lately it has been quite often.  Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  

The previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  

Whenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word ""bliss"".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  

It was simply perfect.",5.0

One story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more.

I spoke to an unhelpful front desker who I asked to forward me to her manager which then hesitated and proceeded to do what I had originally asked of her then asked her again to forward me to her manager.

The 3 Flashers ""chicken nuggets"" are gluten free but are tiny in size and cost $3 so basically $1 each. One of my daughter's Flashers were just a little larger than a quarter. Everything is a la carte also so you buy fries and drink separate. My Grain burger was really good but it cost $6.  No complaints with friendliness, taste, or cleanliness of the place.

4129,UVrLD8Jg_mTsvYpyERX8rw,"Tavern in the Square is the kind of place I would come back to for simple appetizers to get some food in my belly when I haven't had a chance to have dinner before having drinks. I ordered the electric lemonade it was delicious and kind of strong despite all the ice. I am glad I split the big dig fries with someone as it was huge portion, and really good. Although waffle fries smothered in cheese and sour cream,  you have to be  a real moron to mess that up.

When I first arrived and was waiting for others to joined me, I sat at the bar next to some guy, who got meatloaf that didn't seem all that great, I caught some of his conversation with the bartender and he was asking her what kind of meat was in there, and said it was dry and tasteless and didn't taste like beef. She offered to call the manager.  We moved to a table after that so I don't know what happen with it.  I definitely  wouldn't come here for dinner. This seems more like the kind of place to grab a few simple dishes. The bar was a nice size but pretty crowded by eight, but it was Friday. 

One last note the waitresses and some of the bartenders seem to be lacking in customer service skills. When I first arrived I saw them clustered at the end of the bar, I looked their way for a while, and eventually had to wave my hand.  There was a blonde facing me she looked over blankly several times and didn't tell the bartender who was in charge of my side that I need service so I ended up waiting a while before she came over. After we got a table the same blonde again,  asked us to move (without knowing we had permission from the hostess and waitress) on one hand I know she was just doing her job, but I felt like she should have asked her coworkers first, or even us before ordering us to move. It wasn't a big deal or anything, and after we told her she just said ok, so I know she wasn't trying to be rude. The red headed waitress who ended up serving me was great, although I  felt bad because I ordered from her then tipped at the table so I owe her one next time I go there.",3.0

OK, I didn't REALLY expect to see any of them......but I would have liked the bartender to be a little bit nicer though.  She was obviously bothered that she had another customer - not that there were very many to begin with.  

Decent beer selection, and decent basic menu (as I expected).  My burger was cooked the way I ordered it.......thing is, there was nothing special at all about it.  A five guys burger is tastier, and a whole lot cheaper.  The onion strings were good, but again - not great.  The special Whalburger sauce that came with it (thousand island) was good.....helped to give the burger some taste.

Luckily, it was really good, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted.  I got a side salad to go with it, which was plenty for dinner.

It was recommended that we go here for brunch...needless to say whomever told me this, is a genius.

Fresh brunch food, delicious infused vodka's, awesome buttermilk biscuits.

I ordered the ""roll over""  two potato cakes that had a egg scramble with delicious sausage that wasn't gross and covered in grease and then all of this was topped with your choice of a bacon gravy or a mushroom and rosemary gravy.  Personally, I chose the mushroom rosemary gravy and I think that it was hands down the best gravy I had ever tried.

I might has well licked the entire plate because it looked like it when I was finished.  The flavors were just right and I was shocked at the lack of greasiness that usual breakfast foods come with and their perfectly prepared dishes were done to my liking!

4153,KL-TRoxHMSozgSod75m5gg,"Having been here before, a few years ago, I was quite confident that I would still like it here! After an unproductive shopping spree on Boxing Day, we decided to have a nice lunch at Toyama. 

Before asking for a table, I took a peek at their lunch AYCE menu just to make sure it's worthwhile. $12.95 per head. Oyster and scallop motoyaki was offered - a rarity in lunch AYCE menus - so, it was a done deal! The robata or grill menu was also plentiful with beef skewers, shortribs and other meats. 

The ordering process was standard. You are given a sheet with all the items on it, and you write down the amount you want beside each item. As we went down the sheet, we realized that a few of the items from the menu were missing on the sheet. Namely, the robata beef skewers and shortribs. I asked the waitress about it and apparently, the menu is old and the sheet is new. In short, no more beef items. 

I wonder why they kept the old menu? Budget cuts? Laziness? In any case, this was verging on false advertising! I'm glad the chicken wings and chicken karaage (fried chicken) was still on the order sheet. 

Service was slow. So slow. We spent more time waiting than eating. It was busy; but not that busy. 

One consolation we have is that the food is prepared fresh every time. Everything came piping hot. The motoyaki made us all very happy and we had quite a few pieces each! 

But, the surprises don't stop here. When we got the bill, it was about $80+ in total for 5 people. There was an included 10% gratuity. We did the math, and the subtotal was still wrong. I took our bill to the cashier and asked about the subtotal. She quickly pulled out an ordering sheet and said: ""Holiday! We charge $1 extra!"" I looked again and sure enough, there it was in the smallest of prints. 

My hubby commented that Boxing Day is by no means a ""holiday"", to which the cashier had no reply. She stood there as if she didn't understand him. By the way, this place is run and, probably owned, by chinese people. I didn't want to argue, so I paid and left.

We have had friends and my brother (who eats there when he is in town) tell us good reviews, however, our experience wasn't as great as theirs.

Strawberry Margarita -- a drizzle of strawberry does not turn a regular margarita into a strawberry one. It had an odd taste to it -- not horrible but not great. I didn't finish it and I am not someone that leaves before I finish my drink.

Seafood Fondue -- VERY CHEESY and the description didn't mention that it had tons of mushrooms in it. I am not a fan of mushrooms. The cheese on the top was good but the cheese that was mixed with the seafood (scallops, shrimp & crawfish) was very runny. Not like any other seafood fondue we have ever had before.

Kid's Cheeseburger -- the meat was very very dry. G said he preferred the school cafeteria's burger over what was on his plate. Frozen french fries were nothing special either.

Combo Plate w/Grilled Shrimp, Salmon & Stuffed Shrimp -- grilled shrimp was bland and took 3 lemon wedges to give it a touch of flavor; salmon was okay but nothing special; stuffed shrimp was good but had a touch too much Old Bay Seaoning on it.

Combo Plate w/Grilled Shrimp, Blackened Catfish & Stuffed Shrimp -- E says that his grilled shimp was like mine, he liked the stuffed shrimp and the catfish was okay.

Red Beans & Rice (side dish) -- this did have good flavor and I enjoyed it
Steamed Brocoli -- nothing exciting

Jalapeno Hushpuppies -- I am pretty sure that someone forgot the jalapenos. These hushpuppies were bland. When I order something that has jalapeno in it, I expect a kick to it and these did not deliver at all.

Here, it costs $3 for only one cup.  What's that all about?  I find the whole ""Clover"" thing a little unnecessary.  They charge you extra for a 'personalized' french press, but Sip serves only french press coffee and is much cheaper.

The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.

This past time was no different, though I should not have ordered as much food as I did.  My friend and I shared the mac and cheese (a HUGE portion - omg), and another dish (I don't remember what), AND a side of brussels sprouts, which was great, and reignited my interest in roasted veggies (and gave me a new taste for brussels sprouts!).  Too much food, but delicious.  The tomatoes in the mac and cheese add some flavor contrast to the rich, creamy taste/texture.

I was intrigued by the cocktail menu, but didn't order anything other than wine, because I watched the bartender make some of those drinks, and they took so long to make, I waited for almost ten minutes for a glass of wine.

4180,j-SmH477Q6x2tCWynmg_zg,"This was my first visit to Belle Isle Bayou and it may not be a completely fair assessment because I got our order to go. Personally, I feel a to-go order should be just as good as an in-restaurant order but in any event, here's my experience. I ordered the Debris Po-boy sandwich, if you're from the New Orleans area you know that Debris is the leftovers from the cuttings of a steamship round roast beef, succulent and delicious.  That's what I got. I called the order in and asked the person on the phone if I could get au jus on the side. She had no idea what I was speaking of. I did get some sort of sauce, it was a delicious slightly vinegar-y garlic-y concoction and complemented the roast beef so I forgave the order taker. The roast beef was well seasoned, served on a grilled roll with shredded cabbage and included what appears to be homemade potato chips with spicy seasoning. Very good. I also ordered the fried shrimp po-boy, the shrimp were crunchy on the outside, moist and delicious on the inside, they were on the same sort of grilled roll, tasted as if it had been dressed with the same vinegar-garlic sauce as the Debris and had shredded cabbage. Because I didn't know the sandwiches came with potato chips which is not mentioned on the website, I ordered some of the ""Lagniappes"" (side orders), I asked for collards, gumbo and red beans and rice. I was told that the gumbo doesn't come as a side. That was disappointing, but I opted for the cheese grits. The collards were tasty but had some rather large stems and hardly any pot-likker, a southern no-no, also I must mention that the container was half full, so I paid full price for half a serving. The red beans and rice were way overcooked and tasted like delicious library paste that did not lend any bean gravy to the rice underneath. Being from the south, I know grits. The grits were good, but they were not what I would call cheese grits. Real cheese grits are smooth and cheesy through and through. A bit of shredded cheese on top of some grits does not cut it as cheese grits to me. Again, not up to par. Look-y here good Bayou folks, bring it up a notch or two. Someone in that kitchen has talent but needs to care about your customers. Make your place great so it will be around a while. Give us folks that are laying down our hard earned money what we deserve. The bread wasn't as fresh as it had been 2 days ago, the shredded cabbage on the sandwiches is a cheap way of putting some veggie crunch on the po-boy, which I didn't hate but if you're going to serve shredded cabbage, shred it, don't put big hunks of cabbage on my sandwich. It would be even better if you could offer folks the option of getting shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and pickles which is what real NO po-boys come with. If a new customer asks for a side of gumbo, what's the harm in accommodating them? Come-on you're a new restaurant, don't you want customers? Prepare real cheese grits, make sure you give the customer a whole side when they pay for it and please don't serve red beans and rice that are past their prime. There are some kinks that need to be worked out but I have high hopes and will be back for another Debris!  Mwen swete w bòn chans.",3.0

I decided to take the bike to a different shop, I took it to Daytona Yamaha on Hastings street in Vancouver, right around the corner from Motomethod. They assured me they would get my bike running properly and they did, it runs great now!
Finally I can ride my motorcycle with what was supposed to be a ""freshly rebuilt engine ready to go""

The tasting is $85; we also opted for the drink pairing $45. There were 13 courses that were paired with four wines and two beers. 

They take pride in working with local farmers and ranchers to create small plates using fresh seasonal ingredients. As a result, the menu is ever-changing. 

Our first trio of plates, were paired with L'Conti Brut/Blanquette de Limoux/France. 

Funyuns and caviar, such a perplexing first bite. We were in for a treat.Pimento, this might just be the perfect hors-d'oeuvre. I could eat these all day. Beet Trifle with grilled mushroom and blue cheese cookie. This was oddly delicious. 

The next pairing was Adelbert's Philosophizer Saison/Austin. We were hooked from the first sip.

Yellowtail, carrot, pistachio miso, caramel - I thought anticipated this dish as a favorite, it was enjoyable but one of my least favorite of night.Morel, avocado - earthy, rich and perfectly creamy.

The next two dishes were paired with 2013 Weingut Robert Weil Trocken/Rheingau,Germany.

Scrambled egg, crawfish boil. This was positively scrumptious. More, please!Carbonara, I adore it when chefs play with food. Squid noodles and all the flavor of a carbonara.

The next wine was 2011 Gerard Bertrand ""Grand Terroir"" Tautavel Blend/Cotes du Roussilion, France.Radish, pork fat, smoked cashew - a wonderful surprise of flavors.Duck, radiccio, loquat - this was another dish, I expected to standout, but it was also a least favorite.

Our last wine of the evening was 2013 Franco Espanolas Diamante/ Rioja, Spain.

Sunchoke cereal, was the most unusual dish. It reminded me of Cocoa Pebbles, I mean that in the best way.Chamomile, berries - This was the best dessert that I can recollect. The berries had such intense flavor it was incredible! I ate my husband's too.

The final pairing was Prearis Quadrupel/Belgium.Mesquite bean, chocolate - This play on the churro was very yummy, but I gave mine to the husband after a taste since I wanted to savor the berries from the last dessert.

Tonight was a special occasion, and we wanted to try something new.  Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!

This is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.

There's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.

We were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.

I tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.

Oh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.

We were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese / gorgonzola yumminess.",5.0

But nonetheless, lets get to the food aspect:
Ordered the simple basic omurice. Was good. Egg was nicely pan fried, but was still left moist. I guess I would've prefered it if it was a tad bit more fluffy. Taste was there, but of course a bit bland, but thats where you have fun with your ketchup! Omurice, isn't omurice without your ketchup design :) Underneath the nice plain egg, is your lightly fried and flavored rice, with edamame beans. I think the mixture of the rice and plain omurice goes well together. And what an omurice should be like :)

Portions are a bit small for us, greedy westernized folks. But really.. thats the portion we should eat on a regular basis. Plus its only ~$7. :)

Ordered the Macha Latte. Its literally.. Warm milk with macha powder. Very strong macha flavor. Not sweet, wish they added a whee bit of sugar or honey (maybe i'm just too accustomed to the overly sweet green tea latte at starbucks).

When I arrived, I was told that I would be seeing Stephanie Delaney. Not the doctor, but the physician's assistant. Huh. Ok. Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor...

Stephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns. She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription. And a $20 co-pay for not seeing an actual doctor. Hmm. 

Took several months of the medication and saw no difference. I call the office to see if I can up the dosage (which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn't effective) and I was told I need to book an appointment. Oh, I see. I get medication that doesn't work and have to come in and pay yet another co-pay just to have the dosage changed (as was suggested the first time). And it's not like they had to test my blood or anything to make sure levels were okay. I literally sat down, said nope no changes, and got a new prescription.

Time to find a new dermatologist.",1.0

I got some sort of steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions.  First of all, for $18, there wasn't much steak which was very disappointing.   I cant say if it was cooked to order or not since there was so little meat.   There were certainly more mushrooms and onions than meat.   Also, the bread was very crusty.   Too crusty.   The dish also came with french fries which were very greasy.  Only half were edible.  The rest seemed soaked in oil and were droopy.   

Overall, not a great meal.   I certainly would not go back given the price.  I can think of a number of places that are much better.

4231,Qtjb0kmEX2EH6ef1jtd9pA,"So have an hankering for Hainanese chicken but none can be found in Austin so I figured I would try the Thai version as the Thai Kun version was pretty good. Friends recommended the Thai Cuisine version so off we went.

First of all the entranceway where you had to wait to be seated was a mess. People stacked up and the host came but he was so involved with a lady with a missing online order that he ignored all the people stacking up. After about 5 plus minutes of waiting another gentleman came out from the back apologized and immediately took charge and seated everyone. 

Food that was ordered Pad Thai, Kao Man Kai (steamed chicken version not the fried), a Thai Tea and water. The Thai tea that came was awesome. It was a very tall glass, very surprised and impressed. The Pad Thai that came was tasty but the noodles were a bit over cooked but not too badly done. I do recommend this dish if you come looking for it. 

The Kao Man Kai is a whole other story, so much I had to devote nearly my whole review on it. It came and it looked dry, like drink my whole huge Thai Tea and another glass of water dry. It's supposed to be the Thai version of Hainanese chicken. It's supposed to be tender and juicy with nicely steamed rice made with the chicken broth/fat. It's was the complete opposite. First of all it was all white meat, dry skinless breast meat overcooked. Second tasteless, sigh.  Did I mention skinless? You are supposed to leave the skin on, not necessarily to eat, it's so when you cook/steam it that it does not dry up so horribly. The rice I was hoping had redeeming features, it didn't. It was steamed then looked like tossed with what looked like little fried onion bits. What it ended up being like was steamed soft rice with bits of what felt like uncooked rice (the fried onions that softened a bit in the steamed rice). Highly do not recommend. 

Overall not too bad if you didn't want the chicken.  I wanted to try the purple rice dessert as that is my favorite Thai dessert but after eating the mess of the chicken we wanted our bill and to get out of there. The bill all total was under $30 so not too expensive but next time stick with the noodles dishes.",3.0

I'm right on time for my appointment and I walk up to the glass door, which is locked, but I see the woman (who I assume is going to do my lashes because she's the only one in the small room) and she is on her cell phone.

(b) We found ants in the kitchen and bathroom, they sent pest control, we get back and the ants were still there. The room was directly from the 80's, the worst decorated room I have ever paid $200 per night.

I have dreams about momos. As for entrees, the chicken balls in tomato broth are great. The chicken chili is terrible. Shapta is great, creamy chicken is terrible. I've only had one desert here, the Bhagtsamagu. It was butter soaked bread covered in a light dusting of suger. Greasy. Tasteless. Gross. Only order the Tibetan tea if you feel like playing a joke on someone. It's heinous.",3.0

The waitress never brought us more water and I even had to go up to the bartender to ask for more.  I gave her a dollar tip, which was probably too much.  Also, they ran out of oysters, which sucked.  I had the Seafood Newburg, which was small and not memorable.

4257,GzQflyA8mJ6c-3dcTvjMWQ,"After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return. I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving ""advice"", told me when I break in the new pads/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done.",1.0

I had the Fritos dish with a sliced hot dog in it. Sour cream, chili, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. Kind of reminded me of when I was young and broke and this is all the food I had so just threw it all together and hoped for the best. It was okay, I just think it wasn't up to par with a restaurant, made from scratch meal (I know, all restaurant meals aren't made from scratch).

I had grilled oysters with salad. The oysters were serviceable, the salad dumped right out of a bag onto the same plate. 
One of my companions complained about the thick, heavy amount of grease on her fish and chips. The server was defensive and raised her voice but did end up taking care of the problem. Still it was a bit off putting.

The response by Night Owl?  ""Fine.  It will just have to come out of the driver's pocket.""  Then, he hung-up.

First of all the girl on the phone wouldn't put pussy willows in the bouquet because she said they wouldn't look good. Funny thing is I'm a florist myself and didn't appreciate her argumentative attitude about what I wanted. 

The arrangement came and the design work was horried. It looked nothing like the arrangement online and all the flowers were cut short like an amature had made this. I understand the vase was like a rose bowl but it looked like there was no rythm or reason to the design. Within 2 days half of the lilacs (surprised they even used them in the arrangemen) died.

the gyoza was pretty good. the creamy ramen was not so great to me and the GF, tasted like they poured heavy cream in the broth.

but the shio, damn, ranks in the top five bowls of ramen I've tried. you can taste the richness of the pork in the broth and it's not too heavy either, which was a good thing cause we were headed to stanley park right after. didn't see them hand make any noodles, but don't matter to me where it come from as long as it's good, and these noodles were great, just the right firmness. the pork was a good balance of fat and meat (I like 85% meat 15% fat) and the egg (had to add this extra) was cook perfectly (a lil runny in the middle).

I visited twice in the past week (my first time this year) and had lackluster gelato both times.  Tonight, we each ordered a scoop in cups and had to laugh as we walked out of the store.  I had a full scoop of pistachio and Joe only had like half a scoop of nutella.  Two different people scooped our gelato and clearly they have much different opinions about what constitutes a scoop.  Joe got seriously scammed, it was barely a children's scoop, if that.

Next, the flavour.  The pistachio was sweet but that was about it.  It didn't have any real taste.  The nutella was likewise sweet, but if I were blindfolded it could have been pistachio.

Don't discriminate your customers based on their race, what language they speak, or whether you're friends with them or not. Every customer deserves to be treated the same as any other.

Since my guest and I have no other soup choices, we both order that dish.

Table of six people walk in less than 5 minutes later. One person obviously has been here or knows the people. Waiter guy states they have beef pho but ran out of turmeric noodles. What?

Don't go telling me that you're out of something when you offer it to another six customers right after me. Sure, you might know them. But how does that make you appear to other customers who are in the restaurant that weren't given the option to order that dish because you claimed you were out?

Cherry on top after all of this: $15 minimum for credit cards and debit cards.

My husband and I showed up for lunch today. It wasn't crowded at all so we chose the corner table beside the window. I chose the cod fish and chips with sweet potato fries along with a cup of coffee, and my husband got a half shrimp louie, crab pepper cheese soup, and an oyster shooter, with a vanilla Porter to drink.

Everything was delivered to our table timely and hot.

The cod needed a bit of salt and pepper maybe, but it's a bland fish so I didn't expect much. I feel like the beer batter would have been a better choice so that's on me. The tartar sauce was good and made l for the cods lack of flavor. The fries however... Not only were they pretty close to burnt, but they're definitely frozen from a bag and not worth the upcharge at all. For a $13 meal it was unacceptable. 

My husband liked the oyster shooter and I thought the cocktail sauce tasted really yummy. His salad however, he wasn't as happy with. For a 1/2 size portion the price was fair and it was huge, but although the shrimp was piled high he claimed they were soggy and water-logged like canned shrimp. If it is canned, that is pretty disappointing for a sea food place. 

If there is anything at all worth coming back for, it's that crab pepper cheese soup. Amazing! By far the most flavorful thing we ordered. I don't know if we will go back, but if we do it will be because we're craving soup! 

But all together it's on the pricy side for pretty middle-of-the road food. This place should definitely consider doing fresh cut fries. It was incredibly sad to see a fish and chips place using frozen chips.

I waited for the refund receipt, saw it pop up on my phone and left in a rush, understandably a bit peeved, but I should have known better. I went back to work HANGRY AF, having wasted my entire lunch break.

When I checked my account later that week, I noticed that I hadn't been issued the refund. I check the refund receipt and realize that the guy had sent the refund to another customer's card. Now I have to get on the phone and try to rectify their error to get my money back. 

I'm thoroughly disappointed. Furthermore, considering that this is a fellow black business, I really wanted to support them. Unfortunately, I won't be back to even see if the hype about the food was warranted.

I received a gift certificate for Bostix. Two things to keep in mind when considering giving this gift: 1) You can only redeem these tickets over the phone or in person at a Bostix Booth. 2) If you redeem over the phone, they have to have the gift certificate in hand before they can issue your tickets. If you go to the booth you can only get tickets the day of the show.

Admittedly, I came with a Groupon, so I wouldn't say my experience was very normal. The staff was extremely rude and insisted on seating my group separately because we came with two Groupons. Although we were separate parties, the fact that we were all friends and came at the same time ticked them off. They also tried to make us use only one Groupon and come back next time to use to the other one (uhm...what next time?). The restaurant was nearly empty, but they purposely sat us on opposite sides of the room where we couldn't see each other. I understand that they were trying to protecting their business, but they way they treated us was shocking. If it weren't for the Groupon, we would have walked out on the spot and never came back. Being in the restaurant business is also about treating customers right, and this place utterly fails at that. They are losing clientele fast.

As for the food, the sushi was very good and fresh. Appetizers were good too, but not out of the ordinary. However, the Korean BBQ...if you don't think you can do meat wrong, think again. This is not what Korean BBQ should be like. While it's not absolute garbage, it does not ring true to Korean cuisine. I don't think this place should even be called Apgujung.",1.0

Our go to brunch spot is normally La Provence, but after driving past Babica Hen multiple times and always seeing a large number of people waiting outside on Sunday mid-mornings, I decided to check it out.

The first time I went with my two girlfriends.  After about a half hour wait, which really isn't bad compared to other wait times I've experienced for brunch, we were seated inside and promptly greeted by our server.  I ordered the Dungeness Crab Benedict, which was delicious!  The eggs are local and farm fresh, the potatoes were perfectly seasons (not too salty), and the fruit was fresh.  

The second time was with my boyfriend and his two friends from Seattle.  Our wait time was about 20 minutes (also discovered that they have self serve coffee on the bar for you to enjoy while you wait) and got a table out on the patio area and got to enjoy the sunshine (although it should be noted that due to the flowers that are outside, there are a few bees flying in the area).  This time I ordered the Shredded Smoked Pork Benedict (if you can't tell, I like eggs benedict) and once again, I enjoyed it very much!  It was served on corn bread, rather than an english muffin, which was an interesting twist, but a good one!

4309,eXzFbjVrpgdji2NGrxFkSg,"My wife and I have been searching for apartments over the last two months, and have dealt with many leasing agents in the apartment front offices. At one point several months ago we gave up on the IMT property due to what we felt was a lack of effort. We recently revisited the IMT to give it another shot because we did love the property and we happen to get helped by Gary Stiil. From the moment he greeted us it was like night and day from any other leasing agent we had dealt with over the last three months. It was very close to closing time and in fact I suspect during the tour of the property it was past time for him to go home. He never once referred to the time and we never got the impression he was trying to hurry it along. I even mentioned it being near closing time and he shrugged it off

When we were done we explained to him we were determined to get a first floor two bedroom apartment with a yard and would be willing to wait for that to come available. I have had this similar conversation with other leasing agents and never heard back from them even after being assured  they will contact us when one came up. Gary took our information and made the same promise. Much to my surprise two weeks later I get an email from Gary informing us that he had found the two bedroom apartment with a yard. 

Gary is a real standout and complete professional. He made the tour enjoyable and fun and followed up on his promise. I will also add that after the tour that day my wife and I were hanging out near the property talking when we saw Gary leaving. As he walked by we talk for a moment before he went on,  and that's when I realized he was waiting for us to finish so he could go home, and never let on. So if you are looking for an apartment at this property I highly recommend working with Gary",5.0

What can I say that 500 other haven't said already? Not sure, but here's my 2 shiny pennies!

Pops & I are of Germanic heritage. He'd been hankering for a trip to Frankenmuth MI - while I would rather have a pencil stuck in my temple. I suggested we try a trip to the German Village in C-bus and he was game for it. While the wifey is not a huge fan of german food I assured her I'd make a suitable suggestion from the menu for her.

Fast forward - we're at our table (seating can be tight when busy) near the Autobahn buffet and looking over the menu - prices on everything BUT the buffet, which sort of gives me a bit of anxiety. I suggest babe order the weiner schnitzel (she likes a good tenderloin, schnitzel is the great grand father) while Pops decides a reuben is in order. Our server informs me the dinner Autobahn buffet is $15 which I leap at. (and their desserts are discouted if you order a buffet AND its $3 cheaper at lunch!!!!)

Sorry you guys have to wait, I'm already heading to the buffet!  Skip over the salad and straight to meat - brats, bahama mamas, mild bahama mamas, knockwurst, breaded baked chicken, warm german potato salad, red cabbage, mac n cheese and sauerkraut. Should have gotten 2 plates!

I loved my Oma's cooking but I wish she'd had Schmidt's recipes - especially for the german potato salad. Best ever and I must recreate.

Some say the bahama mamas are spicy. Nah. But if you love garlic, and I LOVE garlic, you must sample their knockwurst. Guaranteed to give you dragon breath tomorrow!!!! For me the standout sausage was truly the bratwurst. Absolutely friggin fantastic. And NO, I discovered a few days later ... you cannot order bratwursts delivered online. Ye Gods!

Pops loved his reuben and sweetie said she was very happy with the schnitzel. [duh]

So the brat was standout. But our takeaway was the vanilla cream puff. We had to have it packed to go - no way we could eat. We 3 split the next morning at our hotel - wishing we hadn't just gotten one.

The apartments are so darn old, dusty and has a depressing décor and inadequate lighting. The furniture looks and feel so cheap perhaps from the early 80s.

The experience coming into the theater, however, is another story.  The men doing security as well as a few officers were extremely, extremely aggressive and hostile.  I have been to hundreds of rock shows, plays, speeches, etc. and I have never felt such a heightened state of alarm as these men yelled at us - a crowd made up mostly of middle-aged women - spoke down to us, made sarcastic comments if we asked questions, etc.  It was unnecessary and unpleasant to say the least.  It felt very much like a police state and there was absolutely no need for it at all.  I don't ever want to feel that way again.  We all paid for our tickets and are members of this community.  Why were we treated like this?  It made no sense and caused many people to feel panicked, as if something bad was about to go down.  

It didn't help that we had balcony seats and we couldn't actually fit into them due to the narrow aisles.  If one were elderly, disabled, or over 5' tall, forget it.

Pilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach.

They really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs.

If anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you).

We submitted everything for approval to the underwriter and after 3 weeks of waiting we still didn't have an answer. We also never got any response as to what we would need to do to get approved or what amount we could even be looking at. I have never seen a mortgage broker so lackadaisical. You are far better off going with a larger and more national company than a local one. A national company would have access to several banks not just a small local one.

4343,h_g9L53aRmAvLNRtEToSdQ,"LA Fitness is the first ""big box"" gym I've been to that hasn't made me ridiculously uncomfortable.  I tried 24 Hour in the Pearl, Bally's downtown, they all suck.  Maybe it's just cuz it's new, but LA Fitness doesn't feel as gross.  
It's new, so it's clean.  There's not that meat-market feel you get at 24 hour.  
...Ok, so I'm trying to come up with more pros, but I can't.  It's big, the towels are too small, the staff are overly salesy, the tv's are so far away I can't read the captions, there's not enough open space (I'm not big on weight machines, I'm more the yoga ball/dumb-bell type), it's crazy busy right after work.
But I like it!  
Don't get me wrong, I still miss my first and favorite gym, but this is the best I've found in Portland.  Yes, their sales people are a bit obnoxious, but they warm up after a while.  Just don't let them oversell you.  If you only need a single club membership make sure you get that one.  They tried to get me on the multi-club one so I could go to the Lloyd center one when it opens.  Why would I want to go to the Lloyd center?  They try to sell you towel service.  Towels are free.  
On the plus side memberships are month to month.  I'm afraid of commitment, plus this place is new, who knows what it will look like in a year, so that's a big plus for me.
Bottom line, if you can get past the sales pitch LA Fitness is a decent place to workout.",3.0

4348,8UsN-sCfN67XgGmtcEQO7A,"The worst experience I have ever had with any kind of eye care.    

The  doctor who gave the eye exam was slipshod, disorganized. and distracted. Every prescription he did for me was wrong, and every prescription was wrong because he did not test properly in the first place.   He rushed through the exam  - failed to ask about dilation,  failed to use a reading card etc - and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at 2 min increments  (he was also ""examining"" several other patients during the same 15 min stint.).

On top of that, he engaged in aggressive sales practices - my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses/lenses.  But here, in front of me, he set the price of a very $$$$ glasses I did not need  - luckliy I was wary by that point and did not make the purchase.  He also spent more time explaining different payment options than he'd spent  actually  examining my eyes. 

The  prescription he gave me was a disaster - it made me naseous and dizzy .  I had to go back and have the part-time doctor make things right - which she did. But none of these problems should have happened in the first place.  

And there  was a run-around about whether I would be ""allowed"" to get a refund for  the pair of glasses I did get there -- based on the faulty prescription the doctor there had provided!!!  (They were also unable to locate one of my prescriptions, because it was never written up. Looks like the  doctor had, literally, phoned it in.)  I had to get very pushy to get basic good business  practice, and simple fairness, out of this shop.   I never dreamed getting an eye exam would lead to a situation so tense and adversarial, but there you are. 

You go to these places in good faith - expecting a competent eye exam by a competent practioner.   In my experience, the main doctor here operates in bad faith -- and is backed by a sales team that is aggressive and incompetent too.",1.0

Two months ago I ordered pick-up and they ended up making the wrong pizza, so I waited for the right one and the manager let me take both for my trouble. They turned around the second one in 15 mins, very hot when they gave it to me. The manager was very nice and great customer service. 

The second time was quite worse. I was on my way back from jumping my girlfriend's car and decided to stop in for a pizza as I wasn't feeling up to cooking. I ordered a 14"" BBQ chicken pizza and garlic knots (my go-to). I paid and told the waitress I would be outside as I had my dog with me. Told me it would be 20-25 mins. A little over 25 mins later I threw by dog back in the car and went inside to check on the pizza. Turns out they had given it to a dine-in table that walked in while I was sitting there. Worse off that wasn't even the pizza they ordered. Guy said that he would make me another by since I paid there was nothing else they could do...waited another 25 mins until the delivery diver came out to give me my pizza.

However, it quickly went downhill from there. Once we were in the park, we got in line for Manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for ""technical difficulties."" That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. Once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. We then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when I say that EVERY SINGLE ONE had an issue, I am not exaggerating! Kraken and Journey to Atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and Mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! Dark clouds should not shut down rides! Anyway....

At Journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. The bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which I may now understand why not. We left Journey to ride Kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as NO ONE was there! By the time we got back to Journey, it was fixed. One thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. No surprises here like it used to be! It kinda took the fun out of the ride.

On a positive note, we saw the Dolphin and Sea Lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. I personally loved Antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. That was really cool. 

Lastly, the park closed at 6 PM but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 PM to try to usher you out of the park. An employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. I have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it.

He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, ""No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.""

Here comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by ""That's fine with me.""

BTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office! And despite your upward creeping prices since, I have come back at least once a year because I loved the unpretentious atmosphere. I'm not sure what changed, but on principle I won't be supporting a business that lacks respect for their customers.

4381,XZyfGgDwUK2WXOSzWNL-Xg,"A perfect example that looks and decor aren't everything. Despite all the flashy cars outside and the amazing interior and ambiance, the food and service of Slate are comparable to your local Outback Steakhouse.  I am sure you are thinking that I am being extreme comparing a high concept farm to table restaurant to that of a fake Australian chain restaurant but it is simply a fact.

To start, the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and very well designed.  It has a great ambiance to it and I loved the setup of Slate.

Unfortunately this is where things stopped being good and our first impression of the interior faded away as we sat down to begin our dining experience.  Now to be fair, they were busy and everyone was running around.  We did go on a Saturday night and based on the cars outside this was definitely a popular destination for those who were seeking an ""upscale"" dining experience. 

However, no matter how busy a restaurant and its staff may be, there is no excuse that it takes 20 minutes just to get a coke.  I don't remember the servers name but he seemed to have literally forgotten about us at one point.  He was pleasant and asked us if we wanted drinks. I wanted a coke and my girlfriend an alcoholic beverage.  Now I get that her drink needed to made but still could have gotten my coke sooner than 20 minutes.  It is bad enough they don't even give you Ice Water but to have the appetizer arrive before our drinks was ridiculous. We had the calamari which was pretty solid but when you are drinking lukewarm water with it, it takes away from the pleasure of the meal. 

We eventually did get our drinks and waited patiently for the food.  She had flat iron steak and I had the Ribs.  Her steak came out cold as did her side order of asparagus. It wasn't bad but just cold. My ribs were solid (think Outback or any local BBQ restaurant) and the french fries were excellent. 

If you are looking for some amazing french fries than Slate is the place to be. For some decent food, you can do better. Again, I don't think the food was bad. However the price of the establishment really demands that the food taste above and beyond what one can get at a corporate chain restaurant. You can taste the difference when you go to certain upscale restaurants. At Slate you can't and that is the problem.",2.0

The stone monuments, many of which are gorgeous and worth visiting to see on their own, just end up adding to the experience, especially if you are able to disassociate them from their morbid significance.

It's America's oldest arboretum/cemetery/elysium, based off of the Pre Lachaise in Paris, though I honestly think it is more beautiful, perhaps because if feels more naturey  and pretty than I remember the Pre Lachaise being.

175 acres of rolling hills, ponds, wildlife ranging from frogs, herons, to woodchucks, a tower where you can get a near perfect view of Boston, 700 different species are represented in the cemeteries 5,500 trees, all of the paths have horticulturaly themed names...what isn't there to love? If you are history minded, you can go and seek out the graves of some of the cemetery's more famous ""inhabitants"" such as Isabella Stewart Gardner, William Gray, Winslow Homer, or Mary Baker Eddy. The cemetery also offers guides describing the different trees, birds, wildlife, and plants you can encounter during your explorations of the grounds.

In the summer, nothing is more peaceful or tranquil than grabbing a book, my camera, a bottle of water, maybe a friend, and sitting next to one of the ponds, feeling the sun on my skin and listening to the frogs serenade each other.

Settled the bill with the dentist and went home assuming it was squared.   Wrong. In the end, we were stuck with yet another bill from the lab. 
Long story short, paid $$$  just for a 'check up' --didn't even get a cleaning.  It was a very very disappointing experience.

I'd prefer to stick to the places that actually cook their naan the traditional way (as opposed to rubbery microwaved pita bread). You know you're at a rip-off Indian takeout when you run out of curry before naan. I'm used to the opposite. Overall, small servings, bad naan, dried out and flavourless chicken.

It's a pretty easy venue to get to as long as you know it's not easy to find and figure it out on a map first.

4425,8uKuCzGvaVFEm76oaAwxOg,"I'm with other reviewers who were underwhelmed.  Portland has some viscious competition for breakfast places but even so...the good experience here ended with being seated quickly (early on a Sunday).
Decor - I can get past less than chic surroundings when all else is worthy.  In this case it just gave us flaws to look at while waiting.
Service - bad is really all you can say.  Impolite to rude.  Orders were incorrect.  Generally it didn't seem if anyone cared if we were happy or not.
Food - over-priced and underwhelming.  Everything was very basic and portions were small.  I prefer a portion like this to the 2000 cal meal you are presented other places, but not when I'm paying over $10 for a plate with no meat or seafood on it.  Like another reviewer, we were also given one sliced strawberry (in October) as the fruit with the meal.

4426,scJHd73sz0oNsfWSn-0D8A,"They really should take down all of those annoying signs claiming there is such a thing as a ""Fast Lane"" on the Mass Pike.  None of the lanes are fast.  In fact, if you drive over 10 MPH through them, it won't scan your transponder and you'll get a citation in the mail.  Awesome.

Speaking of citations, from what I understand, the MA turnpike authority likes to hand those out like lollypops.  I've gotten a couple of them for driving through the fast lane with a perfectly good, functioning transponder with plenty of money loaded on it.  It's not one of the shitty Chinese ones you get from MA (at least you don't have to pay money for those anymore), it's one of the good ones from NY that actually work.  The MA turnpike authority makes you fill out paper work to appeal the $50 citation.  They made the paper work easy to fill out -- you literally check a box if you have a working transponder, which makes me think this type of thing happens ALL THE DAMN TIME. As if it isn't annoying enough that you have to do that in the first place, they hit you with a $5 administrative fee + the price of the toll.  Seriously?  I have to pay you because you fucked up?  I did nothing wrong.  Take the toll money and admit that you made a mistake.  I have a theory that they just randomly pick people to charge a $50 citation to in hopes of making up some of the money that the pike is hemorrhaging.  Here's an idea, get rid of the tolls and you won't need any of the personelle and buildings to run it.

I'm still baffled how they get away with their fines.  Imagine if Walmart worked like the Mass Pike.  I'm sorry ma'am, I overcharged you for your tube socks.  I'll refund the money, but I need to charge you the full price of the socks (not the sale price) and charge your credit card a $5 administrative fee.  There would be massive outrage, and people would boycott Walmart.  I'm pretty sure that would also be illegal, yet it's OK if the state does it.  Just one more example of how screwed up MA is.",1.0

I remembered this as pretty good pizza, much better than Fellinis, so I visited again.

I ordered a couple of slices, each with a topping.  Because I don't really like cheese that well I asked for a little extra sauce on top to cover it up.  I routinely do this at all pizza joints.

After finishing the slices, that were really large, I received the bill and noticed that I had been charged an additional 50 cents per slice for the sauce. There wasn't that much sauce there, even with the extra sauce.  This, on top of the other charges for the toppings I ordered.

The bill came to 10.97 plus tip for 2 slices and a glass of tea.   I complained about the sauce charge and the waitress, a really cute young lady, apologized and said that it was what the button added automatically.

4436,l8cq9ZQ5Cwbhiv2q_TJx_g,"After staying away for about two years, I was pleasantly surprised on a recent return trip that at least some of the things that made this restaurant a favorite when it first opened had returned.  A brief history is important.  When the restaurant first opened, it had a variety of reasonably priced comfort food items on the menu.  (My favorite was the salmon with bowtie pasta and vodka sauce.)  And it had a really nice wine by the glass list. And, it played soft selections of Sinatra and other pieces of the kind you hear on the ""Singers and Standards"" channel on the cable.  A little later, they built out the back into a patio, and successfully screened it from the Kroger loading dock next door so that it made for a delightful outside experience on summer nights. (That grocery store closed long ago, so no more problems there.)  It was a perfect spot for the Brookhaven/Club neighborhood around it.  Then two bad things happened, and then a third.  First, the restaurant got too full of itself and it's wine selection, and kept upping the wine selection until a glass of wine was in the $18 to $25 range -- really a non-starter for a restaurant that by that time had seats in the booths that were beginning to fail.  Then they changed chefs (I presume) because the food quality went down.  And later, worst of all, they changed the music to loud, contemporary vocals, which I find extremely annoying during dinner.  

So I stayed away, for several years.  Having just returned -- twice now in the past couple of months, I was pleased with the new menu that contains a nice variety of dishes.  The several I have tried have all been good.  And, equally important, they brought the prices of the wines by the glass back down to a reasonable level.  The music on the inside was still too loud and annoying for my taste, but fortunately on the patio it was quieter and very pleasant.  Welcome back, Terra Terroir.",3.0

Well 25 minutes later, i still didn't get my drink. So I asked another waitress, she brought it right to me after I told her what happened. She asked me who our waitress was, I pointed my finger (Hell yes, I did. I was pissed) - Well, our bad waitress acted all aggressive towards us the remainder of the night.

My friends who still live in ATL discovered the restaurant and go all the time, so we came here with a group of 12 girls on the Friday night of my bachelorette party weekend for dinner and drinks.  I literally couldn't think of a more fun restaurant atmosphere and am so grateful for this place!

The restaurant is small and cozy, and looks like your standard authentic Italian restaurant.... if that restaurant was drunk (and I mean that in the best way!)  Everything glows red because of the rope lights everywhere, and there is SO MUCH TO LOOK AT!  Framed pictures and posters and signs and paper lanterns and chairs hanging from the ceiling....  And there are racks of hats throughout the restaurant that you can not only borrow to wear during dinner, but are seemingly encouraged to!  Everyone in my party borrowed a fun hat - mine was a sequined cowboy hat with a rhinestone tiara on top!  They play their music pretty loudly, and it's upbeat and fun.  The disco ball will randomly start spinning and when you least expect it the fog machine will go off.  And in the back room where we were sitting all of this organized chaos was offset by a large TV screen showing scenic and peaceful views of Italy.  

The food itself was average at best.  I started with the fried calamari appetizer and it was okay, but tasted a bit under seasoned.  For my entrée I got the ""classical rendition"" fettuccini alfredo, which was also just fair.  The noodles tasted homemade, but the sauce was also under seasoned and very oily.  Also, this place isn't necessarily cheap for the food they're serving - the fettuccini was $22.95.  But I think you honestly pay for the atmosphere and good vibes there, and that's why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 2 or 3.  That food for that price would have been disappointing if I wasn't having such a blast in such a fun place with my friends!

The restaurant also gave us all complimentary limoncello shots in honor of my bachelorette weekend, which was delicious and so very nice of them!  The bottle of limoncello was frozen in a bucket with a bunch of lemons, which makes for a pretty neat presentation (though it probably doesn't make it the easiest to pour).  Basically, this was the perfect spot for this weekend and we all really enjoyed ourselves.  They welcomed us with open arms and made sure we had fun!  Sure the food isn't the best ever, but really Atlanta isn't even known for having amazing Italian food so this should be no shock.

Good fried rice requires very little seasoning, usually just a pinch of salt and a sprinkle of soy sauce (for coloring more than anything else).   In order for fried rice to be good, it has to soak up the qi of the wok.   You see, it's actually a physical workout to stir-fry rice, and if you can't taste the labor of love that went into it, it's probably not good fried rice.  I doubt that much of the Pork Fried Rice I ate today met much of a wok.  It was just everything mushed together with a lot of oil and soy sauce.

That being said, it is also farther away than either of the other 2 cantonese restaurants here in ATX.

Food was pretty good, very homely chinese feel for me.  We got:

1. BBQ sampler: duck, roast pork and bbq pork.  It was a bit cold which was kinda disappointing. 
2. Crab Meat and Fish Maw Soup: Good, its been awhile since I last had this and the flavors reminded me of home.  I thought it was a bit salty, but everyone else thought it wasn't salty enough....
3. Beef with Chinese Broccoli:Tastes good, nothing special though.
4. Scallops with Chinese Vegetables: They don't skimp of the scallops thats for sure.  Vegetables are well flavored in the sauce too.
5.  Some Crispy Shrimp dish: don't remember what its called but it was nice and crunchy, not too much taste beyond the fried though.
6. Chinese Pork Chop- really good, again something that reminds me of home.  Hard to describe the complexity of the flavors but its a must try.
7. Beef Flat Noodle- the only thing really disappointing on the menu (my favorite dish).  Not that special and defintiely better at First chinese bbq.  Larger portion here though...
8. Seafood hotpot- good, but not great.  The broth was on the weaker side, but still retained that unique hotpot flavor.  Too many veggies though.

With tax the drink was $4.20. For the size, it was really cheap. However, the drink had no pineapple flavour whatsoever. It tasted like a cup of regular green tea.

4491,V5w8UYFCyqp1OdpFuHyIOw,"Went to a pre-opening here.  Loved the concept before I actually tasted anything - a very interesting variety of gourmet burgers - pate burger, po-boy burger, etc.  But the majority of burgers (we sampled most of them that they were serving that night, roughly 6 different ones) missed the mark on this night.  

Apparently the burgers will range from $6 to $50 for a kobe burger, and I think paying more than $10 for any of the burgers I tried would be unsatisfying.  The choice of sides that night were fries, onion rings, Caesar salad and a curry type of cauliflower thing.  I really liked the cauliflower, but others at my table didn't.  The Caesar dressing on the salad had no taste.  The buns were the same on all the burgers and they were nothing special about them.  I would have loved a  thinner bun with some toasty/crispiness to it, whereas theirs were pretty fluffy/oily/bready.

Richard Blaise, while present behind the bar sporadically, did not speak to any of the diners while I was there, which I thought was pretty rude for a ""friends and family"" pre-opening.  I would have liked to heard him talk about the menu he designed.  When i attended a pre-opening at Straits, Chef Chris Yeo chatted with all his diners and it was awesome to hear him talk about his creations.

As mentioned by other reviewers, their food is ""OK"", but not great.  If you're expecting a Snarfs or even a Quiznos, you'll be disappointed.  Also they have recently repainted with brighter colors, but it still gives off an ""institutional"" vibe - they should hang some photos or add some real decorations.

I also echo what others have said about service, I asked for something slightly custom (one of their subs on Panini bread instead of on a sub roll) and the cashier made a point to say that they don't usually do that, but she asked the sandwich-maker and they both said ""OK"".  Great, I tipped an extra buck and looked forward to my sandwich on nice crispy panini bread on this cold winter day.  Ten minutes later (yes, that's the standard wait time), my number comes up, and it's a regular sub.  Seriously disappointing.  The order-delivery person said they could re-make it but my co-workers already had their food and I didn't want to wait yet another ten minutes.  Very dissapointing, and a good reminder of why I avoid this place unless I really have no other options.

Also rating them low because I heard that they were complaining to the city about the food trucks which are starting to stop by the office park, cutting into their business.

It was too late in the day for the Fish and Chips - Sold Out.  So, DH settled for a trio of tacos al pastor - which he said were delicious.  They ran out of steak, he was about to cook & slice up some more. I had the beef burrito.  We waited about 15 minutes for a fresh batch of beef to be cooked.  The burrito was monstrous in size and packed full of Veggies in addition to a generous helping of beef.  I had to cut the burrito in order to eat it, I brought my own utensils & plate - way too big for my mouth!   But almost good. Perfect, if you eat a meal 1x a day, and the meat is not that tender, I've spit some gristle in the meat. I took the 3/4's home for dinner.  The chips that were served with our meals were tasty.  The owner was very friendly and asked how our meals were when we departed.  The setting was pleasant and noticeably free of flying insects, (except black birds).

After eating some of my burrito, I tasted DH's tacos, which was made of pork (we had al pastor tacos before, and I was craving for his taco), but I was disappointed, I told him it tasted like fart. ""What?"" ""It tasted like fart!"" I didn't eat any more of his taco.  Could it be, the burrito taste in my mouth doesn't go with the ingredients from his taco, and the reason why in my mouth it tasted like fart? I'm being honest!

4507,W8-SCuymNLVNzc5HKG2gSQ,"I'm on the fence with Teela Taqueria.  I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.

I opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  

A note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.

The tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico/onions/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.

Unfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings/condiments didn't add up.

It's always a family outing going to Old Dixie, my dad actually worked there when he was a teenager.  We all have our usual orders, I get the two piece dark.  Mom loves the chicken breast.  Dad likes the gizzards.  You can ask them to specialize anything, we like our fries extra crispy.  Their side of mashed potatoes and gravy is the perfect dipping sauce for the fries.  Try it, I promise you'll like it.  

It gets 4 stars from me because the building is about a million years old and isn't the cleanest place.  They don't even have a bathroom inside.  If I drove by the place not knowing what awesome chicken was inside, I wouldn't stop.  But if you can get passed the paneled walls and sticky floor, you will not be disappointed.

Candler Park Fellinis WAS my favorite of all the other Fellinis, mostly because of the location and nice patio, but the last time I went I wasnt so impressed, due to the fact how pathetic the pizza I ordered was when it came to my table, it was easily my worst experience I've had when eating here, I only order 3 toppings, the slice comes to about $4, that I'm not bothered about, it was the way they pathetically sprinkled the most smallest amount of feta cheese I have ever seen, it was a little 1 inch line up the middle of the slice, and the onion...I could have counted the bits of onion on one hand, yeah, about 5 bits of onion, it was weak. 

My family are visiting from the UK in July and I was planning on taking them to the Candler Park location as its so nice in the summer, but now I'm really considering taking them to the Buckhead, Peachtree location instead as I would be too embarrassed if they were to serve us that half arsed weak attempt at a pizza they did when I went there last. 

So that is the reason I removed 1 star, the reason I took away a second star is because of the state of the patio when I visited last, there was shit everywhere, the tables had crap all under them like they didnt know how to sweep up or something and there was bits of pizza stuck to the table leg, and there was a fuck off cockroach harassing me and my friends for a cigarette, he was obviously there for the scraps of food lying around the place and the fact the patio wasnt regularly cleaned was obviously what attracted his kind there.

I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews. There was a bit of a wait for brunch on Saturday, which was fine. We went and got a beer at the CBC across the way. 

The decor inside is pretty cool. The space itself is very large. The menu was also pretty good. The food itself.....well........

I'll flat out admit, the fact I wasn't blown away like everyone else by Mamaleh's was because I've been to Zaftig's in Brookline. To date, they have the best Jewish food I've had. So it was hard not to compare the two. They were out of the meat knish, so I got the potato. I'm aware that a potato knish is not the most exciting thing, but it was severely underseasoned. I know how good knishes (even potato) can be, and mamaleh's completely missed. I also got the lox breakfast. For the price, I expected MUCH more. The quality itself was OK. Nothing to write home about, but the portions were small. I've had this same dish at a number of other places and usually leave full.

My wife got the ""hot"" pastrami sandwich. I put hot in quotes because it was cold when it arrived. Again, for $15 you would expect the sandwich come with fries, or a side or something. But no. The quality of the sandwich was OK again, but still nothing to write home about.

If this was the only Jewish deli I had ever been to, I would've liked it much more. But I know how good it can be, and Mamaleh's came close, but completely missed. They weren't so bad I wouldn't go back. I've had friends who enjoyed it quite a bit, but I'm definitely not running back or recommending it to any of my friends.",2.0

This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership, and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable. 

The place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code. The streets are narrow, so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around. Check in time is at 4pm. Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson, who invites you to breakfast and won't take no for an answer. They extract $20 from you to make sure you show up. (After seeing the place, I sacrificed my $20.)  Finally, a bellman has you follow his golf cart in your car to find your room. By that time, it's 5pm. 

We were excited to bring the kids to play on the 18 hole putt putt course right on property. Sounds much better than it is. However, when we got to the club rental place, they told us all equipment had to be back by 5:15pm. We had 6 minutes if we cared to use them. Of course, checkout time is 10am. Which us fine if you want to get to the parks, but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities. The golf stand didn't open till 9.

When my daughter was looking at the polish colors, the technician asked if she wanted the gel color and I said ""Sure"". I have always had gel over the top of my pink and white acrylics to keep them shiny and strong, so I figured this was the same thing but with color instead of clear. The same effect could be achieved with regular nail polish and a coat of gel on top. When I pointed this out, I was told, ""Oh, we don't do that."" Of course they don't! Why do something that is usually $5 extra when they can dupe you out of $20!!! Which they didn't tell me until the end. As for our full sets themselves, they were both horrible. I knew that what the guy was doing with my nails was wrong, and the guy sitting next to him even joked that I had a look on my face like, ""what is this guy doing?"" And I did, because he was doing the pink part of my pink & whites first, which isn't how anybody who's ever done my nails (about 25 years worth) has ever done them. He told me not to worry, that they would come out better this way. They are lumpy, uneven, too wide and it's almost like he was trying to save on acrylic powder, because there's barely any on the nails. Usually there should be a slight curve of the nails when you look at them from the side. These are completely flat, except of course for the lumps at the bottom and tip of the nails. I kept pointing out things for him to fix, like one spot that literally had NO acrylic on it, and he was irritated that I was questioning him. So he finally ""finishes"" and asks me how they look and I put my hands down in front of him, looked him in the eye and said, ""How do YOU think they look?"" He inspects his work, fiddles around and files here and there, and tells me to go wash my hands. Also, when I asked him what the difference in price was between the pink and whites I was getting, and the regular acrylics my daughter was getting, he acted like he didn't understand me. I rephrased 3 different ways and he still acted confused until I said, ""Are the pink & whites like $40 and the regular $25? Or.... "" and he said, ""Yes"". What a coincidence that I guessed the prices perfectly! There is no price menu on the wall, so be careful about what you're being charged. Overall it was horrible.

However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.

There were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda ""meh"" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.

I will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.

First, the pool table is positioned horribly. One of the corners is right next to a crowded doorway. Not only do you have to be mindful of people, the door itself is in the way. You essentially can't shoot from that corner of the table. An easy fix would be to take that door off entirely and just have an open doorway. 
Secondly, the drinks are pretty watered down. I've ordered a drink at the bar on a weekend and with dinner on a weekday (the sliders are pretty good). Despite the bartender being incredibly friendly during dinner, I was questioning if there was even alcohol in my cocktail (maybe I'm just an alcoholic). While there's no cover at this new location, you'll probably end up spending more on drinks and parking.

4549,J5QNjn8eSNgtqo_azjVsAg,"A basic standard mall which has been improving over the years. Two floors with the food court and restrooms on the second floor. It's a very clean and simple mall.
A lot of the usual main stores you will find at any other malls. Food court is decent with the main mall foods. There are a few restaurants attached to the mall such as Outback Steakhouse and a newly opened Trago Mexican Restaurant. There's also a pet store in the mall where you can see or purchase puppies, kittens, bunnies, fish, etc. 
A big kids play area right near the main entrance. There's a library on the second floor. The Cinetopia is also inside the mall which was just newly added a few years ago. A new Gold's Gym will be opening where the old Nordstrom use to be. Good seating area around especially by the Starbucks and Teavana is a big open area. Pretty much all the major phone services has a kiosk here.
During major holidays like Christmas, Santa Claus will be there to take pictures. 
Bad thing about the mall is that there is no wifi throughout the entire mall. When they renovated the mall few years ago they took out the escalators/elevator from the middle and now they are on both ends of the mall. I guess it's a good way to make people walk the entire mall to go up or down but sucks when you know where you want to go and have to walk farther than you have to. After school time you will see a lot of high schoolers who hang around here. 
It's a good place to walk and window shop but the small size of the mall and lack of stores can limit your exploration.",3.0
4550,Yu2CRBt_vqrRLIP5xN8n1Q,"Just a hungry yelper looking for something easy, off the beaten path, and free from logos and slogans. Well, the place wasn't as independent as I was hoping. Still a fair commercial feel going on inside complete with ™s on the menu. Corporate places can get the theme down and polished but sometimes lack in authenticity once the place is running.

The place is kind of like a cross between Quisnos and Jimmy Johns. The sandwiches are very meat-centric. The feel of the place is like they were trying for a bit of an east coast vibe but the only part they really got to was the random yelling of words by the staff.

I get to the line, browse through the quite large bottled beverage selection to see all the typical mass-produced overly sugary selections. Passed on the beverages. Moved passed to order my sandwich. Opted for A Wreck for myself who's ingredients read like an Italian sandwich, and a Hammie for the kiddo. It's ham and cheese.

I was a bit impressed with guy1's calm demeanor in a place that's still fairly busy at a peak dinner time. Was preparing the order ahead of me while simultaneously taking my order and writing nothing down or entering anything into an order and he took the order calmly and confidently and didn't make me feel rushed and his demeanor didn't make me feel like he was rushed or over-worked.

The odd part is the yelling. Once I put in my order he yells out my order and the other two yell the order back to suggest that they heard him. This is a cheap gimmick pulled from fish markets and east coast shops. Guy1's like ""Hey, I'm making a sandwich!"" and the other two chirp back ""He's making a sandwich/That guy's making a sandwich!""

Is this really necessary? Guy2's whole job is to take the meat and cheese bread off the toaster that Guy1 put in place and put your choice of 9 different condiments and vegetables on the sandwich for 8 hours straight. Should he really be so surprised to find a sandwich manifest itself onto his side of the toaster without the guy yelling into the side of his head from 3 feet away? I'd like to see some headsets secret agent style where they whisper into their sleeves that the customer who just walked passed them and the sign on the door that says ""Potbelly Sandwich Shop"" is indeed here to order a sandwich and is definitely not lost.

I'm such a slacker on receipts. I forget to take them and when they tell me the total of my order they might as well be telling me what they heard on The View last night, because I'm not listening.

A Wreck reminded me of a toasted version of The Italian Night Club from Jimmy Johns, but toasted and on ciabatta and smaller, but I think I ordered the smaller one. The hot peppers actually have some spice to them, where Jimmy's are sweet and zesty these have a mild spice that slowly accumulates until the end of the sandwich where it's still tolerable to my sensibilities. The cured meats actually kind of taste like cured meats, which is always a bonus. Sometimes at these shops it just tastes like a slightly more flavorful bologna.

I nabbed a bit of the Hammie from the kiddo. (for science). The ham was quite flavorful where many others just taste like muted versions of themselves. Notes of smokiness and well hydrated without tasting like it was reconstituted in it's own juices like the turkey packets you get at the grocery store. It's truly noteworthy that most of the sandwich made it into the kids mouth! You parents know this means something!

To test the practicality of the yelling, I've decided to make this a practice at home when I'm up at 6:30 making breakfast. ""I'm making Cap'n Crunch™!"" I'll update and let you know how it works in a week. (No I won't).",4.0

We'd been poking around Lonsdale market and just wanted somewhere nice and chill to sit, eat and hopefully catch some rays with this lovely weather we've been having. Mario's may look a little 'commercialised' with all the 'Italian Grandma' (or should I say Nona) decor but I found it to be really cute and cosy. 

The servers are friendly too (I was delighted to hear the English accent of one of the waiters as he busied to and fro - a little slice of home!) and very attentive. Our server was really sweet and friendly without coming off like a pest - she was very good at gauging when we needed something like a drink or an appy. 

My friends have varying tastes in food and Rob is just plain fussy, but we were able to find something that suited all our palettes. I had the Ceasar Salad Piadini off the lunch menu which was really fresh and filling too, for a salad. 

The sangria here is soooo nice, I had two and think I may have drank them too quickly as they were so good! Rob had the traditional burger - lovely juicy patty on a soft bun with home fries and fresh salad - who can argue with that? Jenn and Michelle shared a platter of crispy fried goodies.

I followed that with a ham and fontina sandwich, mostly because I was at clarklewis and their cooking technique never disappoints me. So, yes. I got a perfectly toasted sandwich that was not overwhelmed by any element and included a hot, grainy mustard.

4561,lcTzmBYSJsTNTtaoY6Zlnw,"I've always liked Flip (I've been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions - Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened  when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. 

This past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating (two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. 

No biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the ""Oaxaca Burger""  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.

I chose their special of the day: the ""Surf and Turf"" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, ""garlic herb white wine butter"", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!

We finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio ""Liquid Nitrogen"" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. 

The service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.

My one tiny complaint/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side - and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?",4.0

Although all 17 reviews thus far have been very positive (no 3-star, 2-star, or 1-star reviews), my GF and I had a poor experience which I relate below.

1. AMBIANCE - 2 STARS - Ernie's isn't at all quaint or charming. It has tacky things on the walls, and it's dark, depressing, and exceedingly cramped. It seats only 20 people, comprised of 12 people seated at tables and 8 people seated at the very tight counter.

In the table area, all of the tables are only 24 inches square, which provides far too little room to put food. There are only 3 tables for 2 people, and 3 tables abutting each other to seat a party of 6 people. Honestly, it's really much more of a place to get food to go, not a good place to sit and dine.

Indeed, this area is very uncomfortable, especially when other people come in just too order lunch to go. When this occurs, the commotion disturbs the peace of all the 12 seated patrons.

At the counter, the passageway behind the rotating stools is so narrow that you have to squeeze by sideways if you need to use the restroom.

2. OVERALL FOOD QUALITY - 2 STARS - I ate a Corned Beef Hash Omelet, Home Fries, and buttered Wheat Toast.

HASH OMELET - 1 STAR - The egg that enveloped the Hash tasted good, but the Hash itself tasted horrible and was inedible.

Pam, the Waitress/Owner, freely admitted that the Hash wasn't home-made, and I strongly suspect it came directly from a can, very similar to something made by Hormel. After just one bite, I scraped it away and ate nothing but the egg.

HOME FRIES - 2.5 STARS - Soft and tasteless.

The potatoes had been diced small, cooked soft inside and out (I'd have preferred a crispy outside) , but were almost tasteless. They had obviously been fried in tasteless Wesson Oil instead of a tasty oil such as bacon fat, no seasoning had been applied to the exterior, and no tasty additions like onions had been included.

WHEAT TOAST - 3.5 STARS - Standard fare bread. Nothing fancy or whole grain.

3. WAITRESS SERVICE - 2 STARS - Pam is definitely a nice woman with a nice personality, and I know she means well. However, her level of service needs to improve.

Pam placed my GF's pancake on my side of the cramped table, instead of on my GF's side. I believe that Pam did this because it was a convenient open spot. However, Pam could have easily spent a few seconds to rearrange the table slightly to make room for my GF's pancake on her own side. Instead, she left this task to us, which is more like a disservice than a service.

Also, when Pam brought us our first glasses of water, they came with ice. That was good. However, when Pam brought us our second glasses of water, they came with no ice. Instead, she asked us if we wanted ice by saying, ""you don't need ice, do ya?"" which was anything but the right thing to say or do.",2.0

4566,TIbUkgRQ-gASk1VPT0frzg,"On the corner of Colonial and Dean Rd in Orlando sits a fairly new dog park called Downey Dog Park. It's been there for five to six years and is not very large in size. It's also not in the best area.

This park is big enough if you have a small dog who needs some space to run around, but if you have a bigger dog you're better off going to one of the other choice dog parks in the area. A good majority of the dogs that come here are pit bulls and other ""dangerous"" breeds, which is what makes this park unappealing to most who know about it.

Mulch covers the ground and a dark green fence keeps the dogs confined. There are benches and chairs for the owners to sit on while their pet plays, but are usually overtaken by the dogs. Like most parks, the hours are restricted and posted on the front gate. And, as is usual, you must pick up after your pet.

4567,eUDaCpV-kMeHvRj-8dvnlw,"Fun izakaya atmosphere, good selection, but sort of feels like a Japanese food theme park

The menu is extensive and features many of my favorite Japanese dishes.  Overall, the food is usually quite good, but occasionally the flavor, quality, and portions can be inconsistent.  

Part of the issue might be that by trying to execute on so many different types of Japanese cuisine, they can't be excellent at all of them.  There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food.

They have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way).

The yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites.

It has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant.

Early and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours)

Service is usually good, but can be slow when the restaurant is really busy, especially at dinner.  Waits for a table can be very long.",4.0
4568,-WmKDp5K3wU2hIwT1h7zrg,"Whoever decided it was a good idea to go to this place after work on Friday must have been smoking the crack pipe. We had a reservation for about 30 people, but the staff hadn't really set up the tables in a way that we could all sit together and talk, so we had to get creative and do it ourselves. 

The drinks, were not too expensive, but that's probably because they were pretty watered down. I asked for my usual, double rum and diet coke, which arrived to me in a short glass, which should have been my first clue. Since it was in a short glass, I was expecting it to be much stronger, as the ratio of booze to bevie was smaller. I am not a large person, but if I can drink four of these and not feel a little wobbly, that's probably not a good thing. When you are a pub, don't you think the one thing people come to you for should be amazing?

We ordered the ""cheesy"" nachos as per the menu which were $16.75! 
$16.75!!!!!!! SRSLY!
These nachos better be sprinkled with cheese made of gold if they cost that much. The nachos arrive and the first words out of my mouth are W.T.F? There was barely any cheese on our ""cheesy"" nachos. Guacamole was extra so we had almost naked chips with salsa and sour cream. Who's pick was this place again?

The waitress we had was good, she made sure I always had a drink in my hand. I also got a shot from the alternative Zack Morris at the bar, because I was on a mission, and so far I had been unsuccessful. At least I was able to make my tequila-face once last night, so it wasn't a total bust. 

They had a big screen projector with the opening ceremonies of the Paralympics on, and when that was over they had a band playing, but I didn't really stick around for that. There isn't really anything about Ceilis that makes it Irish, besides the fact that it sells Guinness. Why do all Vancouver pubs want to be Irish anyways? Why can't we have more Mexican pubs with donkeys that you have to ride when you get really drunk? I can tell you one thing, I won't be spending my St. Patrick's Day at Ceilis.",2.0
4569,cGaOasMcupO_YbAixs1kAg,"We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. 

Some of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise that's all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.

The ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue ""New England fishing scheme"" decor.

But we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didn't love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks/conversation/etc. exclusively to him (I'm female). And it didn't seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: we're here for the food. So....

I love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if you're lucky). I'll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.

The bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasn't fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, I've had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isn't a good sign that they know what they're doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and it's wasteful on the food costs. (We didn't really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)

I love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more ""lobster pot pie"" than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.

As for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. 

With the bisque being ""good,"" the salmon chowder being ""meh,"" the newberg being ""downright awful,"" and the roll being ""meh,"" nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there/return/be romantic/eat more/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere.

I didn't even know how to pronounce gyro until I asked the owner, who is a very nice and approachable woman (like another user mentioned (I wanted to confirm), it's ""yiro."").  All I know is that I tried the lamb gyro and it was very tasty.  It was a bit small for the price ($9 with some greens that I ended up stuffing into it because it looked bare otherwise).  However, the owner (I think it was her) was super nice and out of nowhere walked up to me and the other gentleman who was there working on his laptop and handed us some ""bagnye"" or something like that.  Basically it was deep-fried sweet balls over honey drizzle, sprinkled with cinnamon.  These were really good.  Granted, I love honey and cinnamon; I could DRINK this mixture all day.  The consistency was just right.  I guess I got on her good side by complimenting the dessert so much that a few minutes later she walked out with another serving.  At this point I hadn't even touched my gyro but soon found myself well on my way to devouring the 2nd complimentary plate of bagnyes.

This is the first time my Mom and I had bubble tea from this place and boy is it a disaster. 
The tragedy began when my mom who drank the bubble tea an hour before me complained about stomach pain and having to visit the washroom several times. I was skeptical when she first told me and dismissed it as just her having a sensitive stomach. However after a few minutes I realized I should take some precautions as I did not want to risk it. At that point I had only drank less than half of what was in my cup. Fifteen minutes or so passes by when I felt my stomach churning and at that moment I realized it wasn't just my old lady's sensitive stomach that was the problem: it was this cup of laxativ- I mean bubble tea. Thank goodness I stopped drinking it before WWIII happened in my bathroom. Not to mention, my Mom who rarely treats herself to take out/drinks ended up suffering due to your ""bubble tea"". On the bright side, if I ever have constipation problems, I can now purchase a cup-o-laxatives from your store instead of having to spend $14.99 from London Drugs. Talk about value for your money !",1.0
4581,TGZOKqjv8YshnJ6kkWWCvA,"We came on a Saturday night and were surprised that it was almost completely empty. We were a little worried because the only other table there left unsatisfied, but we ended up really enjoying ourselves.

The portions, though not very large, were filling and all had strong flavors. Some dishes were a little too salty and though we all ordered medium spiciness level, our dishes ranged from extremely mild to very spicy. However, the naan was great, especially the garlic naan. 

I also really enjoyed that Punjabi did not skimp on ingredients. The lamb Rogan Josh had a good amount of lamb, and the Malai Kofta had four vegetable balls, while a lot of other places usually only have three. 

The service was courteous, though it was pretty clear that English wasn't their first language, which led to some confusion. They were super nice about splitting the check and were attentive with water refills.

I think this place has a lot of potential. Honestly, I like it more than Diva down the street because their flavors are excellent though a little inconsistent . I'll definitely be coming back to see how this restaurant grows.",3.0

4584,QagJIqOaD8abuC-7K8U7jA,"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! 
I brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.",5.0
4585,dlCnf8Hq8Bf4q84Fg0B7Cw,"House of Blues has a well known reputation of being called ""House of rules"". They strictly turn down anyone from entering the show for the slightest reason or they kick people out easily. Ok I understand that, although it can be slightly frustrating when some innocent people get turned down or kicked out. What I DO NOT understand is why it took an hour and a half (I am not exaggerating. I arrived at the venue at nine and finally entered at 10:25) to allow people into the venue. The line was enormous and went down the block. What made matters worse was that the line hardly moved at a reasonable pace. There were people freezing  (this was at 6 degrees) and it even started to snow. I, and everyone else who had to wait, know the doors open at seven, but we have the freedom to arrive whenever we want. If house of blues wants to avoid absurd lines, poor customer service, freezing customers, visibly unhappy people (ex. people boo-ing) then clearly state when doors will close therefore avoiding absurd waiting and clusters of people or have a better system of getting people into the venue. I paid money expecting to see a full two set venue of Lotus. I only got to see the last set, but was very unhappy with the cold, wait, and lack of organization and coat check. This has made me want to never support the House of Blues corporation ever again. A twenty minute wait is understandable, but an hour and a half?! I had enough time to walk a block and a half to the nearest restrooms and back. The line was still growing too during the wait. Additionally,  tickets were still being sold at 9:30 too.

The dumplings were delicious, however could have been hotter. I'll put that to the lack of wait staff. 
The pork bao were nice but not amazing, the chewy meat with the chewy bun wasn't a great mix. And not enough salad. Perhaps some crunchy cabbage would have gone better for freshness and texture. 

The fried chicken was a disappointment, the batter was too thick and oily. But the chicken itself was nice. It's nothing like a proper Korean friend chicken which is much lighter and clean.

Beyond that, I occasionally do unheard of, taboo things like accessorize and wear shoes that don't have thick rubber soles or steel shanks.

4627,Zl_bSTEajmvPyL_hR62f0A,"I started looking for movers in early January and got kind of freaked out by how expensive, or shifty, or nonprofessional, or whatever that they all seemed to be.

I called an old friend who had been in the moving business years ago and he said, ""You ever use Yelp?"" ""Duh,"" sez I. Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, ""Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars."" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.

So I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.

I called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, ""you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys."" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.

I decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.

You get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)

On moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away ""We might not get this done today, but we'll try,"" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.

And they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this ""2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing."" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.

They took less than 2 1/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.

At the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that ""...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,"" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named ""Eileen"" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, ""Phil."" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. 

These guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.

It was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.

This move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.

I could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.",5.0

We contacted them and was found to only be making 1/2 what was suppose to. This was fixed with no restitution for loss of revenue from January to June. Then come Feb. 2015, in our 4 year old house we had a roof leak. The roofer who installed the original roof stated vents on top of house needed to be replaced. It was noticed that solar panels were installed overtop of all the vents on one side of the house, that needed to be removed. We were told by multiple solar companies that solar panels should NEVER be installed over top of house vents, heat from the attic could harm the solar panels. We had to have Revolve solar out to remove the panels (we had to pay for this) and have the roofer fix the roof. What was suppose to be no more than 4 hours ran into 9 and have panels reinstalled once more our cost. Because vents had to be removed and roof reroofed. Then the attic was not vented enough and we had to install either ridge vent or a power active heat removal fan at our cost. We wound up installing a solar ventilation fan. But, we wound up spending a whole lot of money we should not have to.

Last time, I missed out on the Kelaguen Mannok, and I made certain not to get shut out again. I basically did everything short of calling in to reserve a bowl. Spicy pandas gotta eat, you know.

Kelaguen Mannok is a cold dish with chopped grilled chicken, lemon, grated coconut, peppers, and onions. Some minced Bird's Eye chili also gets added to make it a tad spicier. I honestly don't know what took me so long to order this. OK, so there are 700 food carts in Portland. Can't find this elsewhere (at least to my knowledge).

With all due respect to the Bird's Eye chili, the lemon really makes this dish pop that much more. The refreshing aspect keeps me coming back for another bite. Slowly but surely, the heat will intensify, but it's not gonna make me race to the nearest water fountain.

Hineksa Agaga (red rice) is really white rice with achotte added to give it its color. It's characterized as having a slightly sweet, nutty, and peppery flavor. Achotte is basically used like saffron to flavor and color rice.

Make sure you ask for the Finadene, because that stuff is awesome. Soy sauce, lemon, chili peppers, onions. The heart of Chamorro cuisine. Add it to your rice and Kelaguen Mannok, then thank me after you've recovered from your food coma.

I had two drinks and was pretty buzzed to borderline drunk (note: I am a person who has a couple of drinks every night after work, so I am not really a lightweight).

I ordered a French 75, which was good, though sadly not the best I've ever had.  Then I ordered the chocolate martini, which was AMAZING.  It's thin and tastes like pure cocoa, not thick and sugary at all.  My husband had the Corpse Reviver #2, which he proclaimed to be fantastic.

The Food: Gnocchi were of average quality. The sauce was medicore, very thin, and the halved cherry tomatoes were an odd addition. My fiancee had the shrimp risotto, which was rather bland, but the shrimp was cooked very well. We finished the dinner with a $8 cannolli.

I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. 

I am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right.

I was so excited to come back on Saturday and dig into a bucket of mussels. The appetizer I remembered had been just that: a big bucket full of mussels in a delicious sauce. This time the appetizer was a smallish bowl - the mussels were fresh, but I didn't LOVE the sauce. My friend and I split the crab cake sandwich as our main meal and it was pretty good - I think she may have liked it more than I did. 

The service was fine (our waitress drew a cute little crab on our check haha) but I really hated the table she sat us at. The table was held up by thick bars and I just happen to hate sitting on stools. Also, the table had some pretty big gaps in it so I was neurotically worried that my drink was going to spill. Being uncomfortable and anxious can definitely put a damper on any meal.

I am reluctant to say the best turkey burger because the restaurant advertised it as such on their menu and I don't want to validate their cockiness. 
Rafiki loses a star here for an intrusive, but probably well-intentioned, intervention. My gf got a salad that had radicchio in it and was mentioning to me a very normal volume that the salad was mediocre when I asked how it was. The manager, who was apparently eavesdropping on our conversation, proceeded to come over to the table and tell us that he couldn't help but overhear that she didn't like the salad. He explained that radicchio is a ""acquired taste"", then came back a second time when we were done with this course and accused my girlfriend of just pushing it around her plate and not eating it. He offered to take it off the bill, which was a nice gesture, though it wasn't the restaurant's fault that we didn't like radicchio and chose poorly. Anyway, it was a bit too intrusive and my gf was worried about what she said for the rest of dinner lest the manager come back and say he overheard something about the food.",3.0

1) do you like kareoke? If yes, then stay downstairs, sign yourself and your buddies up, and sing away on stage. 
2) do you like dancing to pop music and whatever else you'd like to request? If yes, then go upstairs where there is a second bar and a dj spinning melodies you can groove to.
Finally, 3) do you like meat on a stick?

Some of the reviews are a bit harsh.. and I'm not sure why. If you're a hotel/motel snob, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if you want a comfortable, clean, affordable place to rest your head, with speedy shuttle service and decent cafeteria food within walking distance, than this is your place! 

The property is huge, so like the parks, be prepared to do a bit of walking! The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other. I also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room. My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. 

The rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. 

The food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria. I don't know if we were just starving when we got back from the parks, but the Chicken Parmesan was pretty outstanding. They also have overpriced beer in the coolers if you're feeling tense. ;)",5.0

Once you find this small storefront you will put it in your internal GPS.

You aren't coming here for the decor but for the FOOD which is delicious, affordable and plentiful.

The owners Veth and her husband (terrible with names) are very sweet and welcoming.  I took takeout for the family and was sent home with some delicious extras, bread, slaw, etc.

The drunken noodles are savory.  Both the tofu and chicken come with plenty of protein and leave you with at least a second meal of leftovers.

I had the pulled pork cuban sandwich and it was delicious.  The homemade sweetbread made it great and the slice of ham was sublime.  It made my vegetarian partner think twice.

My fiancé chose the garlic black pepper entree, which was sautéed with a choice of meat with black pepper, garlic, onion, broccoli, bell pepper and topped with dried garlic. You can also choose to add some heat to any dish that they have. With this being our first time here, we played it safe with our choices (and level of spiciness) and just chose chicken, but I noticed a few other people's dishes looked very appetizing as well.

4758,5qbSgqUjD-h8e_2aCEXhgw,"I always wonder, when people rave about places like Dixie Crossroads, whether they take most of their meals directly out of a dumpster. All the ""unforgettables"" this place has garnered are, frankly, a symptom of people who must eat very badly most of the time, which is to say, Americans. That said: Yes, of course it's a tourist trap. Yes, of course it's overpriced. But in terms of Florida rip-off restaurants, it isn't even one of the worst. Compared to say, the embarrassing greed of Bubba Gump's, which might well have been inspired by a place just like this, it's a wonder of the modern world. But what Dixie Crossroads really is, is an immense, cavernous, completely anonymous mess hall, and that's the kind of dining experience you'll have here: anonymous. There is no charm at all (unless you think Cracker Barrel-type kitsch is charming; and, in that case, you'll be enchanted by the bad oil paintings of herons at sunset). Instead, there's enormous turnover and the sense of being served on an assembly line. The food is not bad, but it isn't all that special either. The portions are tiny (if you think $1.40 is a fair price for one, single cooked shrimp, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you). All you can say about the service is that they're doing the best they can, given that there's almost certainly the modern-day equivalent of a drum master in the kitchen beating out a rhythm so that the oarsmen and -women keep rowing at ramming speed. There's no pleasure in witnessing that or in being served in that way. Dixie Crossroads' claim to ""Southern hospitality"" is nothing more than one of the dozens of empty phrases that have kept the greater Orlando area in business for decades and which might still work some magic on your Republican great aunt. There is, though, precious little hospitality to be had here. Eating at Dixie Crossroads isn't for the food, anyway, of course; it's for the ""experience,"" and if it's the experience you're looking for, you might find it fun. If you actually enjoy food, expect to be treated like a human being when you're paying good money for a meal, or are depressed by wait staff that seem on the verge of a nervous breakdown, then give Dixie Crossroads a miss.",2.0

Came here for lunch on a quiet weekday. When we walked in, instead of getting seated we had to order and pay from the bar first.

My husband and I both ordered the same thing, but they did not come out the same. His was missing two things in fact. I don't even know how that happened. The sandwich got really messy too and there was no silverware to be found. (World's tiniest napkins here, btw). I also fetched my own bottle of ketchup.

I usually get the tofu teriyaki bowl, which consists of tofu (not deep fried which is HUGE in my book) brown rice, fresh veggies and a sweetish teriyaki sauce.   It's my go-to healthy option for lunch and it's consistently good every time.  

Today I strayed form the norm and decided on the veggie burger and un-fries (insert eye roll here, un-fries?).  I must admit that the fries are tasty.  They barely made it back to the office.  They were a bit oilier than I thought baked fries should be but that just made them tastier I suppose.  The veggie burger was ok.  Nothing to scream about.  I got it with everything on it which made it messy on the scale of a double whopper.  It had a bit too much of everything on it and some sort of seasoned salt on the veggie burger itself that was unevenly applied causing me to get mouthfuls of saltiness.  That being said the lettuce and tomato were very fresh and the bun was whole wheat and soft.  I think if I had scaled back on the toppings and asked for no salt I would have enjoyed it more.

While I was waiting for my burger I noticed some other people's food coming out of the kitchen.  The entrees and hot wraps looked good from where I was standing.

Some posts here say that the place is pricey and I'll admit that it's no McDonalds.  No dollar menu.  However my veggie burger was about $5 and the fries were $1.79.  The burger was huge and the fries were a normal ""small fry"" portion.  Pricey for fast food?  Maybe but it's really on par with DTX prices for a decent meal.

4801,p0ChhEm7PpTg9saDQbRCMQ,"I've dined there two times, with differing experiences. I will review my most recent which was this past Saturday night. The place was full and the staff seemed a little in the weeds. There is no host or hostess to greet you, so we stood there for a good 5 minutes before being ushered to our seats. So it's a small room, we *had* to have been seen before then, not to mention that my friends are two of the tallest people I know personally and there's no *way* they weren't spotted! We were a party of 4 with a reservation which we were about 5 minutes late for - oopsie. I'm sure that's somehow my fault. Once seated, it took some time to be approached to give our drink order (another 7 minutes or so), and once we gave that order, it became painfully clear that a hostess was not the only staff member they were missing. There is no bartender there, and one of the waiters? the busboy? made the drinks. Which were quite tasty, but took over 10 minutes to get to us. I was beginning to wish I ordered wine instead of a Pineapple Martini (but I loooooove Skyy Pineapple, so I *had* to). So, we've been here for 20 minutes already and are just getting our drinks. The busboy did serve us water, which I drank right away and was not refilled. Even when asked. 

The waiter was apologetic, but seemed to shuffle the blame off onto the busboy, and I'm not certain that everything was that poor kid's fault. In any event, we ordered our food, appetizers came out within a reasonable time (I loved my tomato, gorgonzola salad, and wish I had some right now). My dining companions seemed to enjoy theirs as well. But then there was a huge lag before the entrees. Like more than a half an hour, which goes by even more slowly when the drinks are being made by Slowy McSlowerson. And still no water! They brought more bread though, which I know tickled one of my DCs. ""You mean the bread started tickling him??"" No - it's a figure of speech, sheesh! When the food did arrive, the pasta e fagiole I ordered seemed bland (my Mom used to make it with salt pork for a nice meaty, slightly smoky flavor). This one lacked seasoning so I had to put a fair amount of salt and cheese on it to make it palatable. My friend ordered the chicken broccoli and ziti but wanted the homemade fusili instead which they goofed on and forgot. They did realize their mistake, though, and offered a free dessert. My other dining companions seemed pleased with their food (one ordered a veal marsala that I did not try and the other - my favorite - ordered off the menu, actually, a request they were kind enough to accommodate - it was gnocchi caprese with pesto sauce instead of tomato sauce, and it was gooeyyummydelicious)! 

This is not a good place to go to if you're ""fungry"" or will get cranky because you haven't eaten all day before showing up. At least not on the weekend. The weeknight experience I had with my favorite DC was quite different as the service wasn't scattered or slow. I'll go back there, because of the value and convenience ($150.00 before tip for 4 people, all of whom drank alcohol and got plenty of food), but perhaps not on a weekend, and perhaps not to order the pasta e fagiole again.

We were seated by the manager?..  he didn't give us any lunch menus... and never checked back in with us, actually, the whole time he looked like he was in a pissed off mood.  

I ordered the french toast and it was good but I was disappointed by a number of small things, first, I ordered coffee and the cream came in those little individual servings like you'd get at a gas station, sort of lame for a restaurant, and the server brought it over in a handful... uhm.. ok... 

Second, my friend asked for butter, same thing... little individual servings placed on the table in a handful.   I think our server was new, she was ok, but she couldn't close her mouth when doing things.. it made her look sort of ditzy, and the blond hair didn't help.  But seriously, bringing stuff over in handfuls sort of ruined the experience of dining out.

Ali helped me out with them but I discovered that my massive hulking calves weren't going to fit. :( *proceeded to cry bacon grease* But Ali assured me that not only does John have a tendency to make the calves small on his boots but they CAN be stretched. She also showed me a few other styles that I enjoyed but I still had my heart set on those tall distressed purple boots. She reccommended coming back in a skirt because my jeans were really thick but painted on. 

I came back on my next free day and was helped by Pete. He helped me get my massive calves into those boots. One thing I really appreciated about Pete was he was quite practical and not the slightest bit sharky. In fact, he talked me out of paying them off right then and there until after my reviews at school. Massart Alumni know what's up. 

So I came back the following weekend after getting paid and school was finished to finalize the sale and start the stretching process which took a little under a week. The soft distressed leather stretched quite easily and they fit perfectly afterwards. I was also later helped out weather proofing them and given advice on general care. I could also change the soles out on an older pair of heels I had. Just overall amazing customer service! 

Although now every time I come in, I'm tempted into buying more shoes. The first pair is apparently the gateway. It's a slippery slope from there. EVIL EVIL STORE WITH SHOE TEMPTRESSES! I NEED MY MONEY FOR RENT! NOOOOOO! D:",5.0

There are so many restaurants popping up all the time in Austin that are all style and zero substance and they could all take a note from Tyson Cole.

It's the little things at Uchiko. You know the food is excellent and inspiring, that's a given, but it's really the service that makes them stand out for me. They go so out of their way to make you feel like a guest, not just a customer. Whether it's the bartenders throwing in a free app while you wait for your table or just the honest and knowledgeable recommendations from your waiter. 
Even though we pay easily $200+ when we come here, I never feel ripped off like I do at so many restaurants around town.

The one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses.

Families with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. A big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. Lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38"" and up)

Families with older kids (I'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, Mako, Kraken, and Manta. The height requirement is 54"" and they enforce it! 

Families that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. 

However if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.

On 2/23 the one ""roller coaster"", Atlantis, my son (53"" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. So he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. 

He also wasn't into the shows, which--I mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  

The food service was awful. I'll just say it. The park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. I'm glad we brought our lunch bc I can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food.

While I can appreciate amazing toppings like onion strings, whole grain mustard, aged cheddar, etc., the combination of so many flavours just muddled the experience. The main feature of a burger, the patty, was lacking. 

In short, the burger toppings and sides were probably the tastiest part of the meal.

By the end of my meal, I was left craving more food from elsewhere.",3.0
4862,Rj3XSeUPebLJVHincR_gog,At a friends house watching the NFL playoffs and he asks Round Table or Belagios. I say Round Table... big mistake! They not only took forever to answer the phone. The delivery took over an hour (which is fine). But hr asked for Cheese & Peppers (because I like to eat my pizza the way I want)! And still nothing. So we call back real quick to catch the driver to see if he has any in his car. BUT.... NOBODY WILL ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE! It's now 10pm at night on a Saturday and they still haven't answered the phone.

It's the soup of the day.
Mmm... that does sound good."" -- Dumb & Dumber (1994)

Usually, I love F2O.  I can eat their Mediterranean Salad all day every day (as long as they listen and remove the almonds) and I usually all the Ale Chicken Tenders.  I love this salad, I think it is crazy well-balanced and delicious.  There are crunchy elements, sweet and tangy pieces, salty bits, etc.  It is my favorite.  I love everything they serve... most of the time.

On this trip, I did take out because I had a short amount of time to eat before my next conference call so I needed to take it and run and so I also got a cup of the Wild Mushroom Soup.  Well - let's talk about this soup.  First, not so sure the mushrooms were really wild.  There were chunks of mushrooms, but they were all square and seemed to be the same type.  There were also very large pieces of onion.  And then, all I tasted was dairy - sour cream, cream cheese - not sure which.  But it was too something...chalky?  Thick with an after taste that was not pleasant.  I ended up throwing most of it away.  Certainly not worth the 280 calories the entire bowl would have been... and did I mention it was salty.  A big bowl of blech.

Thank goodness I also got my favorite salad.  They need to rethink this soup from the top down.  I make a killer vegetarian wild mushroom soup that would kick this soups behind.  Get back to the drawing board, F2O.",3.0

It doesn't matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. I've been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcon's hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager didn't even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezy's ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifa's baby's momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - ""Hi, Im AmberRose and I will be your server today..."" All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left ""OH, OK!"" and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she would've given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you don't, you have to go see for yourself.

Besides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when I'm ignored by my waiter but I didn't even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it didn't even phase me.

The food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. I'm really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I don't care if they're country or city. I want them out of a shell. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and they'll bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. 

Try this iHop but remember, do not come extremely hungry. There's always a wait.",4.0

Easy enough to book an appointment, and their location is great if you work in FiDi.

My only complaint is that there is a lot of ambiguity when it comes to nail art prices. It's all subjective depending on the difficulty, but there needs to be more communication about additional charges etc. Their website has a few details, but if you're looking for a more customized set I would definitely request a quote or something next time. I came in to use their nail printer (that I found out about via IG!) but the result wasn't that great - I used a personal image that I sent beforehand, and it the result wasn't what I was expecting. I wish there had been a little more communication about what kinds of pics yield the best results because I would have brought more options then.

I also had some simple nail art done - highly skilled artists that gave me exactly what I was looking for, but paid just over $100 for a relatively ""simple"" set (no charms or crazy nail art) which was a little surprising.

The whole belly fried claims were great!!! Hard to find whole belly's. Yum!!

Tempura Lobster Tail - This was good, and I am pretty sure they left it on the shell so we had no doubt that it was worth the 33 dollars. I would rather get the lobster boiled but the appetizer just came fried.

I booked my daughter's 7th bday party online with MVP with ease.  We had never been to MVP, so we visited the place a week before the party-- the staff was very friendly and showed me the party room/ laser tag 'arena'/ arcade.  I appreciated that.

On the day of the party, we arrived and were greeted just as we walked in and teamed up with a staff member (Marina) who was going to lead the party-- and she did a great job.  The party ran like clockwork, with all decisions in my hands.  Marina told me what was up next (laser tag game, pizza, cake, another game) but let me decide when I wanted to move to the next step.  Not once did I feel pressured or stressed out (and with 4 kids of my own, that happens quick!).

We brought our own cake, but that is all that is allowed-- no outside food, so I couldn't offer snacks to the parents waiting during the laser tag games.  It's a minor thing, but it would've been nice.  The pizza provided was good, but the ice cream was DELICIOUS!  Big servings enough to feed two!  The parents who passed on the cake couldn't resist the ice cream!

MVP was definitely a good choice for 7+ year olds.  The laser tag area is 6000 sq ft with two floors-- it's a series of many, many rooms instead of an 'arena' with obstacles.  The laser tag transforms to a haunted house during this time of year, and the creepy skeleton heads, etc spooked a couple of birthday guests-- either that, or they were just scared of the dark ;)  The 'arcade' mostly has games that give tickets like at Chuck E Cheese-- definitely not the biggest arcade, but it was nice to leave the party room's door open and let the kids run back and forth between the rooms.

We didn't play mini golf due to the weather, but MVP gave us a pass for future visits as well as discount cards for all of our guests.  The parents were more than eager to take one!

It's a cozy place so you won't lose your kid, it's clean, and the staff is very energetic and friendly.  We would definitely do it again.",4.0

My high hopes were lifted even more because of that. The line inside forms right down the middle of the restaurant. Which meant that my guests and I were asked to move out of a servers way many more times than once. Most were nice about it; you can't help being in the way because of how the line is set up.

Perfectly cooked with just the right combo of tortilla and pico.   Love them with a side of queso.   Then there's the Huevos Curra's.  A combo of eggs and carne guisada!?  Sympatico.  I'll have my eggs over-easy on top of that sublime stew...and flour tortillas on the side, please!

My son, who is 8 and can eat a major hunk of road kill, ordered two chorizo egg and cheese breakfast tacos and threw in the towel with a smile on his face after he got through 3/4 of one of them.  

What brunch would be complete without a bloody mary....and they do them well.   Or you can just go full octane and ask your waiter to pair one of their extensive list of tequilas with your meal to sip as eat.   

I always leave here happy and not seeing myself eating for at least 12 hours down the road.

Only ding is that parking can slightly suck if they are hopping....but that's true of a lot of places in Austin.",4.0

4902,Jn82mvTjE3wlyLd0zej6tA,"Aesthetically, the newer, southernmost location of the Hyde Park Grill is great.  Architecturally clean, great patio, slick yet casual bar on the inside, decent wine selection.  But this Hyde Park grill got me thinking:  part of the charm of dining out in Austin is the same thing that can make restaurants here an occasional challenge to review, that is, that the very best local service here is prompt (yet casual), attentive (but not snooty).  And while no one could argue that the new Hyde Park Grill offers a visually simple and appealing approach to dinner, our service was more casual than attentive, our food more adequate than outstanding.  It's a fine line to walk, and not everyone does it well.

Many in our dining party attempted to harden arteries right away:  there were chicken-fried entrees, plenty of cracked pepper fries to go around.    Here's an excerpt from an actual conversation on that front:

Us: so, um, what are you guys known for?  What's good here?
Waitress: (shrugs) the fries, I guess.

This is one of those situations where you really wish you could give extra half-stars, as some of the shenanigans going on outside during our dinner had nothing to do with the restaurant itself (some guy at a nearby table fighting with his girlfriend or parole officer, repeatedly jumping the patio railing and standing on his car in the parking lot...seriously, it was odd), and our food certainly wasn't awful.  But it wasn't great.   Let's hope Hyde Park south works a little harder to bottle some of the magic that's made the original so popular.",2.0

I have done this race twice, so you really have no idea what to expect in terms of the weather. It might be cold or it might be freezing cold. Make sure you have compression pants for this race, you will thank me later. I cannot stress it enough, do not wear cotton clothing, as it does not wick away your sweat. You will be running 15K (9.3 miles) and as you run, you will be sweating and all that sweat will be absorbed by your clothing and wet and freezing cold weather will make you extremely sick... not a good combo. So wear polyester fibers... or better yet wearing cold gear... 

This race is known for their goodie bags, hot chocolate, banana, melted chocolate, a bag of snacks and a very cool fleece jacket that you should not wear during the race.

4906,e0rPFriJKmnuH1du7VhWcQ,"After a walk from the Downtown Hyatt thru a little rain and my sweetie twisting her ankle we arrived at the somewhat hidden but quietly shouting it's presence Myers + Chang. I was having a similar difficulty getting the name to pop up on Yelp! Anyway we arrived @ 5 pm on a Thursday to an almost empty but relatively cozy restaurant. Funky but interestingly decorated I felt comfortably ready to enjoy a fusion experience. My wife selected our choice for our dining experience & in my desire to walk into the unknown I lead the way.
Our arrival was just before the masses of reserved patrons & their dinner times. I tried to get reservations but the earliest was 9:30 pm & me being of the morning person persuasion I'm usually putting one foot into the sack by that time!
My call for a reservation was rewarded with the valuable info that if we showed up early we could sit at the bar in front of the chefs preparing dinner...kinda like a sushi bar. The ""waiter / mater d"" was very friendly & attentive and provided us the lunch menu (since we were early) and the drink menu with the soon to be ready dinner menu...we got the big spectrum treatment. My li'l woman ordered a sake mojito (darn good but a touch more octane would have been nice) and I ordered a caraf of chilled junmai sake with the green papaya slaw w/ chili, peanuts, lime & cilantro...noted w/ 3 stars as HOT!  I'm a seasoned chili pepper enthusiast  or ""chilihead"" & found it mild to my palate. Our waiter brought me some of the Thai chilis that they use just to ""sweeten the deal"" and I grew happier as the experience progressed...yes the sake helped too.
Dinner came quickly and we ordered the wok-roasted mussels ...ooooh yeah they were awesome as we're the Taiwanese Dan Dan noodles then came the steamed bao... oooooh so gooood! If I had less control & more room I could have gone further but restraint prevailed. I was very content and so glad we came thru the rain and hurddles to experience the wonderful food and the passion @ which it was prepared for us. The staff was friendly, helpful and informative so this restaurant has my fondness & support so I recommend you get yourself in there and have a good time!",4.0

4913,7YnO1tbcTSDVXb-kIKCQPQ,"I am so dissapointed with this place. We brought the family for dinner and it was not very crowded, which we were thankful for.

The ordering line moved slow. but finally we placed our orders. Fish tacos, grilled steak burrito and a cheese quesadilla for the kiddo. chips and guacamole for the table.

The toppings line was slow (even with a small crowd) and the only vegetable I was offered was lettuce, not even tomatoes. I tend to like fresh veggies on a nice burrito. the line was very disjointed and we were asked what our order was no less than 4 times. The staff clearly didnt know who's order was who's.

Fish tacos had the smallest sliver of fish on it and was not eligible for the toppings line. They were pretty much a lettuce and tomato taco. Although we were asked if we wanted salsa on it, and said yes. There was no salsa.

Quesadilla was .. well tortilla and cheese. no complaint from the little guy. but there were no kid friendly drink choices for kids except for water. Drink choices were very limited soda, drinks from the bar or water.

Guac was barely passable as avocado. not even a real avocado taste. Dont know how a previous reviewer said it was rich, it wasn't.

To top it all off? We sat down and took our first bites into cold food. not even mildly warm.

I wouldn't waste your time going here unless it is just for a beer and some chips/salsa.",1.0
4914,S-peHXCL9g4496efsQ-RvQ,"Charcuterie Plate: Perfectly good on two visits; Cheese Plate: Likewise; Smorgasbord: Ample, and the addition of a little salad is a nice touch, but while it had good flavor, it was more like an adorable garnish.

Ambience: Good, rustic, pleasant.

'Tomato BIsque:' While 'bisque' used to mean a specific thing, and still does in some quarters, I have come to accept that it now means any kind of pureed, creamy soup. And I have heartily enjoyed many a tomato or root-vegetable 'bisque' since this semantic shift overtook menus. This was not one of those times. 

The soup was lumpy and watery, not creamy or pureed. I will assume, since this is Portland, that they used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, but if the sole constituents of a dish are tomatoes and water, I would argue it doesn't matter much which you use, and that the result is not a soup, let alone a 'bisque.' I like tomatoes, and I like water, but whether it is a sauce, soup, cream soup, confit, compote, or tomato margarita you aim to make, the terrifying reality is that you will need more than those two ingredients, and one of the elements you will need is time.  As this is the sole soup on the menu, its thundering crappiness is yet the more lamentable. This is a soup that in its vacuity and its ponderous, gaping want of substance, could have stripped even Beckett of his otherwise insuperable will to live.

Similarly I was reckless enough to order the 'special' grilled cheese off the specials board. It was indeed special in its singular lack of uniformly-applied cheese and the other special ingredients. To wit, half the sandwich contained the special filling, while the other half gaped at me, rent and bare on the plate like the flat doughy buttocks of a passed-out middle-aged demimondaine in some or other Lautrec I have not seen and do not wish to. 

Half of a Grilled Cheese Sandwich contained no cheese! - which may be shocking and hard to fathom for those who do not believe it is this life that is the actual Hell and that it is only afterwards we all get to pet unicorns and bunnies in the sky with Beckett and Unamuno. But, that crushing truth notwithstanding, the fact is that when I previously have - in this life, not the next sublime one - ordered a grilled cheese, special or otherwise, in nearly all previous circumstances, the cheese portion has generally been uniformly applied to a minimum of 75/80 percent. coverage. Additionally, in past encounters  with this species I have noted that the general practice seems to be that some sort of lipid (butter, oil, margarine: I really don't care!) is applied to the outside, upon which the whole is set upon heat for some time and then turned, with the obvious effect of heating the sandwich from two sides with a heat conductant on either, thereby melting the innards. I regret to say the sandwich, while gently heated, had no oil of any sort applied, and that the cheese (on the half with cheese) remained staunchly unmelted.",2.0
4915,TcTJaHgvWwReAXz1r85WFA,"Certainly not what I expected. Time for a makeover at this hotel.  Room was large with a great view but also poorly lit with mostly  drab color everywhere. Windows were filthy. Furnishings were also a bit dated. Wifi was a challenging connection so finding things of local interest was especially tough as no guide to anything in the hotel or nearby could be found. Thank heavens for the Gideons. At least they did their job.  Hampton at least has an in-room guide that always tells me about the free breakfast, where I can get a pizza and other items of local interest. 

Our stay came with a free continental breakfast. We arrived at the restaurant reception desk and were NEVER seated. We had to find staff and we were told we could just sit anywhere. After we realized that the continental breakfast was little more than toast we opted for the up charge buffet only to find NO PLATES. We solved this by sticking our heads into the kitchen and taking some off of a cart. We filled our plates and had a seat. Halfway through our meal we were finally asked if we would like some coffee.

Most recently we came early on a Friday night and didn't have much choice of tables but we made do.  

Our waiter was very professional and on top of things.  We did not feel rushed and were left to enjoy cocktails and breaks between food. I had a Caesar which was good and spicy but just made with regular old clamato and there was nothing to make it different from any plain Caesar I make at home.  I want drinks to wow me when I'm out. The only thing I don't do is the bean - they are gross. Celery only please it is classic and not out of fashion like the bean( so,last decade). Plus it was in a short old fashioned glass which is completely wrong.  The bar seemed to be the worst thing here.  More later. 

Lettuce wrap was delicious but small portion for the price. Panang  prawn curry was delicious as always and the fettuccine was very good but again a puny portion for the price and then They ask if you'd like the garlic bread with it but don't tell you it's an extra charge. 

All in all the food is very good but really the menu is a bit tired.  I've been eating the same things there for 15 years.  And the interior while nice is again very old and tired- that glass sculpture is past its prime. 

For dessert we had our favourite and really the best dessert anywhere - the key lime pie.  It is super amazing and HUGE.  There is no way one person could finish it unless you had it for your entree!!  We ordered Spanish coffees which at close to $8 each were the biggest clunker of the night.  I was actually shocked.  Instead of special coffee glasses with a sugared rim, tons of whipped cream and a cherry they were in two white dollar store coffee mugs, no sugar rim no cherry or garnish of any kind and just a spoonful of whipped cream,  they were really bad and again the fault of the bar. 

I think this location could use a Reno - it hasn't been done since it was Joey tomatoes.  The 60s scotch and steak house theme is really really done.  And maybe a menu update would be good. And a new bar manager for sure. 

Finally I thought Joeys tried to make itself unchildfriendly- well it didn't work- self centred twenty something's bring their kids in here in droves despite no kids menu, high chairs or change tables because it's where THEY want to go.

4927,69mbd_po1JhbNk3heGKw4g,"Yeah, the bank vault seating is cool, and the cafe is nice and big, but this place is just not that great.

My first complaint is that the aforementioned large square footage of Bloc 11 is totally misused.  There aren't many places to sit in the main part of the cafe.  In back, there are two bank vaults to sit in; one has subway-style seating so you're facing the strangers sitting across from you and have nowhere to rest your book or food, and the other one is a tiny dank pit with no power outlets.  There's another back room with a fireplace and only two tables.  If you sit directly next to the fireplace, your face will burn off.  Trust me, I've been there.

Other problems include slow service and lack of free wifi.  Drinks are small, especially considering what you pay for them.  The bathrooms are clean but boring.  Wheelchair accessibility seems decent, except for the back rooms.  This place is open late, which is nice because the only other cafe option in Union (the superior Sherman) closes at 7.  

Overall, I only go to the Bloc 11 to grab a beverage when the Sherman is closed.  If they amend the poor seating plan and light a fire under the employees' collective asses (alternate use for the fireplace?) to speed up the service, perhaps my ire will decrease.  Until then, see you at the Sherman!",2.0

The outdoor seating looked nice, and the basement was cool, but there was someone napping down there, which isn't particularly welcoming.  I had house coffee and a three seed bagel.

4945,RxtLuT2N6Zw94qlUW51eeA,"I was in the cardiology dept as a patient so I felt extra dutiful to try and eat healthy, and since I had a visitor coming, I thought why order hospital food for dinner?

So I had them pick me up the cobb salad and the baked fries.

It's not the best cobb salad I ever had but one of the best healthy cobb salads I ever had. I just wish I hadn't poured the dressing on. The dressing tasted very chemical. So I'm curious as to what was in the dress, because the rest of the veggies were crispy and fresh in the salad. I think I would have rather eaten without dressing than the one that was given. 

And those fries are good for you? I have to look into this more because I'm sorry they were delicious!! And I wasn't so medicated that I didn't know they were delicious. And fries are a red light food for me. I usually don't allow myself to have real fries because then the fry frenzy begins.

But these were flavorful and crispy. And they weren't piping hot by the time they made it to my hospital bed even. So, I would eat here again. Nice to have a healthier option that is quick and not to expensive.",4.0

On the other hand, my moh (man of honor/bestie) used to come here a lot on Monday nights when it was empty and drink dirty gin martinis (yours truly) and Johnny Walker pink (or black whatever) with our buddy Benny the bartender. BTB turned a blind eye when I put the moh's rocks glasses into my oversized bag so that we could continue the party back at our places. They also have delicious food here. The cobb salad and the black and blue wrap are phenomenal. 

The ambiance sucks on the weekends. Would you like another blue button down shirt to go with your Bud Light, sir? And there is always a line on the weekends. 

Great place to drink in the afternoon in the Spring/Summer time on their downstairs patio, complete with separate bar and 2 plasmas.

The Kenpachi was sold to us like a salesman sells a car, ""This is the only place in FL"" and similar statements. It was a $46 dish that tasted like a salty, squashed and seared frozen fish fillet. The veggies were stated as, ""from The Land"" in Epcot. Who knows if that's true, but they were under cooked. I like them with a bit of crunch but they were more hard than anything.
The New York Strip was ordered medium rare and it came well done. Our waiter said it was good that we sent it back because it was a viened piece of meat. This brings me to a different complaint. Why are the people that help us make our order not the ones that bring it to us? As a customer we are left wondering what to do until the waiter has time to check on us.  
The lobster tails were not the melt in your mouth that these Nova Scotians expected. Lesson learned, eat lobster where lobster is freshly caught.
Now for the good - my husband LOVED the Chilean Sea Bass. The appetizer of Cheese Evolution was fun to try and share. So 2  stars for those dishes.

The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery.

It seems like this place attracts people that go to the movie to text and make Facebook post,  kick your crooked mold smelling seat every time they move and then discuss Facebook and other pressing social issues: where have we seen that actor before? What do you think will happen next? Do you think this popcorn will make my ass even larger than it already is? 


The theater is in desperate need of implementing some serious maintenance upgrades. On top of the rude patrons that seem to frequent this theater. Theater #1 was hot and muggy, hence the comparison to a drive-in in The Summer. Sub sound bleed through from the other theaters disrupted low volume dialogue. The picture was decent but not wide screen. More like an old TV set. The ticket kiosk did not work.


The only redeeming moment to this experience and the only star, was the concession attendant who was nice and personable.  Other than that, there was nothing redeeming.

4966,HxRsE2MVKnZaaQG2teUqkw,"Food: 3 stars. Three of us split the big dumpling platter and most of it was fine. Nothing was dramatically flavorful. The dumplings with beef were particularly bland, but beef dumplings always are and I don't know why anyone makes them.

Service: 3 stars. The host and our server were both extremely nice, but not terribly adept at dealing with anything beyond seating people and bringing them menus and food.

Allergen information: -4 stars.

""I'm allergic to a lot of flowers. Is the mint tea just mint or is it a blend?""
""It's just plain mint.""
*drinks some*
""Hm, I'm getting a mild allergic reaction. Can you confirm that this really just is plain mint?""
""I'll check."" *goes to the kitchen, comes back with an unlabeled plastic box* ""Here it is. It's from Chinatown.""

There were pretty clearly other things mixed in with the mint. What were they? Who knows?

""I'm allergic to star anise. Can you check whether the dumplings are made with five spice powder, and whether star anise is used in the broth for the soup dumplings?""
""I'll ask the cook."" *goes into the kitchen, comes back* ""Sorry, the cook doesn't know because the only people with the recipes are the owner and her mother, and no one else knows exactly what's in anything. To be on the safe side, you should avoid all the dumplings."" 

Given that I was at a DUMPLING RESTAURANT, I felt this was not really an acceptable solution. I settled for skipping the soup dumplings and anything that had five spice powder listed as an ingredient on the menu, and taking preventative Claritin.

I'm sure that if someone's allergic to, say, shellfish, they'd be perfectly able to say ""these things have shrimp, all others are fine"". But not all allergies are to common allergens, and this is why it's crucial to have ingredient lists on hand and not just in the owner's head.

If you don't have major food allergies, go ahead and enjoy the passable dumplings. If you do, the dumplings aren't good enough to be worth the anxiety about whether something's going to trigger a reaction.",2.0

I also love the chorizo papusa appetizer. Little spice, complimented by a vinegary slaw of come sort. Fish taco is phenomenal as well. 

Service is fine. Bar can be understaffed at times (one on doing the whole bar plus service) which creates a slower-than-desired experience. 

After I finally move out of Salem into Boston, I will be at the Wolf whenever I come up here to visit friends.",5.0
4987,5jcPRNjkpkTPHkCxxzXFMw,"The food was god awful.  Not very good service. Ordered the Curras molletes and I'm going to be honest- it was basically hot dog buns with wolf brand chili and cheese on top, baked.  

I sent these back immediately.  I ordered the cochinita pibil.  I love cochinita pibil dishes, but I wasn't a fan.  It was a bit on the sour side for me.  Boyfriend ordered the special- basically a chimichanga.  Nothing special.  The avocado margarita was okay.  

Overall it was too expensive, and it didn't sit well.",2.0

chapter 1 - space
convert an old bank.  keep the vault intact and throw some tables in there because people love that shit.  add a modern, open, loft-like layout with ample seating in several distinct sections, outdoor space, and outlets available for people to bring their compies.  throw some cool local art on the walls to cement that cool-kid community feel.  

you're lookin' good.  real good.

chapter 2 - product
in this chill atmosphere, offer simple but delicious food.  add rich, aromatic coffees and cappuccino with foam so thick you can eat it with a knife and fork.  you can even charge $12 for an egg sandwich and mochaccino, but you're still well on your way to an awesome yelp review!

chapter 3 - service
employ locals.  try to make sure it's obvi they live in somerville & cambridge.  in other words, hire the people that are likely to patronize your place.  make sure they're friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and as chill as the vibe in your swingin'-awesome-bank-vault-having-coffee-house.  

you're so there, dude.  you're tiger woods on his second shot, lookin' for an eagle on that long par 5.  go for the pin and knock that shit down.

chapter 4 - wi-fi
that's all you need.  the icing on the otherwise delicious cake of a cool yelp review.  you could have it goin' on!  give the kids the free wi-fi.  you know they're tethered to their computers and iWhatsits and mp-somethings.  plus they just spent $12 on a cup of coffee and an egg sandwich.  the wi-fi is a give away.  friggin' sbux does it, and it's worked out pretty well for them, yo.

wait.  you want to charge $4.95/hour; $7.95/day; $13.95/month?  oh.  uh. . . .",3.0
4989,JA1Q1yP9Acn42WRSm5dUVw,"Come here with cash. A lot of cash.  An overpriced average tea that doesn't take card. 

I am in touch with my bubble tea and I won't be coming here again. 

Disclaimer: I had a GINORMOUS expectation since I googled best bubble tea in Vancouver (home of amazing Asian food) and this place came first for 2014. Plus, I also had to drive 20 mins to get here from where I stay.  Boyfriend and I were on a chinese food pilgrimage in Vancouver. We live in Seattle so we are somewhat deprived of solid chinese food. After a long day of delicious chinese meals, we want to chase everything down with a perfect cup of bubble tea!

We ended up having hot milk tea with grass jelly and fresh persimmon drink with coconut jelly.  Neither is outstanding. They were good, but definitely not worth the 20 minute drive. 

The reason it is a solid 2 star though is the place only takes cash.  Really? You only take cash? We only had $3 Canadian dollars on us. We were surprised that she didn't take card and definitely wanted to pay her for drinks we had ordered, so we asked if the owner would take US dollars. 

She had a sheepish smile on and said yes but at par value.  I don't think we had much of a choice at that point.  Funny how that works, she wanted to save 5% credit card fee but found it completely acceptable to charge me 20%+ more for my drinks. I ended up paying US$9.75 for my two ok drinks. 

I would have felt much better if the owner at least has a credit card option but charge 5% more for transaction under certain amount of dollars like other hole in a wall places. 

Me no like getting jibbed :(",2.0

4991,ptb_qODzBeNvhD9s32gH4g,"Wonderful little nook of a restaurant...the ambiance of the cozy 12 table room was not lost on my solo dining experience. 

Small but good wine list. They were also willing to splice the appetizers together so I could try the squash blossoms with marscopone and the bruschetta. Delectable! The bruschetta had this amazing cooked spinach and a large melty piece of fresh mozzarella on top. I'm never a veal girl but completely went out on a limb with their homemade veal ravioli with brown butter sauce with pancetta and sage. Truthfully, I think all I heard was brown butter cream sauce and completely forgot about the veal. It was lightly creamy and not overly decadent in richness...and oh how I wanted to lick my plate. 

I would have given it a 5 but the desert recommendation I went with, nutella breadpudding, was cold, thick and well cold. Thankfully they had espresso to suppress my disappointment and the 24 hour pastry shop is across the street!",4.0

4993,nELjv-vo_1-MyvRm5DGbDA,"This was really pretty poor. Upon entry An angry cave troll initially scared us away with her club ...but we had not been to Chang's in so long we resisted our urge to run. (I know that's harsh but it was really bad - every Hostess was unfriendly to the point of being mean) to be fair the place was a mad house but no excuse to be scowling and letting it be known they are not happy to have more customers.  

Once seated, things did not get much better until our clearly overworked waitress came to greet us with a full arm of Martini's she even took our order bedrinked and managed to be sweet - it was impressive which is why the extra star. 

My food was awesome Kung Pow Scallops spicy and warm - however that was the only good dish out of the 6 we received. Rest were cold and bland -

4994,pjgTUx9rH3EJQQB-32w5RQ,Terrible. I ordered a pretzel and Saurbraten.   The pretzel was dry And the mustard they served with mixed with Apple sauce. Terribly sweet. Terribly sweet. Then  It took 45 minutes to get the Saurbraten.  Then when I got it it was so sickeningly sweet that I couldn't eat it. Sugar in the gravy with excessive as well as the sugar in the red cabbage. Spetzel could have been good if it had not had the gravy and theFlavor of the red cabbage mergingWith the spetzel.  Great concept but  Don't ever order the pretzel or Saurbraten!

4999,LHB9Lv7BcQ00DZrm7tB2gg,"Came here with my boyfriend to visit our friend who works in the kitchen. The service was mediocre at best, we were greeted when we came in, but not sat for over 3 minutes after being greeted even though it was slow. We sat at the ramen bar so we could chat with our friend, and I was impressed at how great the kitchen looked! Everything was clean and polished. 
My boyfriend ordered and I quote ""a Sapporo and a hot sale so that I can do sake bombs,"" 10 minutes later we were approached by (who I'm assuming was) the manager to let us know that they don't serve sake bombs but that he's welcome to order the beer and sake separately. I tried to withhold my giggle as the server then proceeded to tell us sheepishly she didn't know what sake bombs were. Ok, totally forgivable. 3 minutes later my cold sake was brought out... in a beer pitcher filled with ice water because the bartender had ""just restocked and the sake wasn't chilled yet."" It's okay, I'll take it. 
Almost 10 minutes after ordering the appetizer they let us know they were out of the Jinya Dynamite so we got the Tempura Brussels, which were phenomenal! We also got the Bun that was on happy hour and it was absolutely perfect amount of fat on the pork. Probably my favorite thing there. 
My boyfriend got the Sprouting Up Ramen and I got the Tonkotsu Black. Both dishes were phenomenal , as we added egg and more meat to both. 
Absolutely no complaints on food, but the service needs improvement.",4.0
